"""Download the raw open-data inputs the pipeline needs, into ``data/raw/``.

This is the CI/runner's "fetch" step (see docs/SPEC_deployment.md): a fresh
GitHub Actions VM has none of the raw inputs, so it must pull them before
``main.py`` can regenerate the map. Run locally the same way to refresh a
snapshot.

Most inputs come from Edmonton's Socrata open-data portal:
  - assessment     q7d6-ambg  (Property Assessment Data, current year)  -> CSV
  - boundaries     65fr-66s6  (Neighbourhood Boundaries)                -> GeoJSON
  - zoning         fixa-tstc  (Zoning Bylaw Geographical Data)          -> GeoJSON
  - roads          9j8t-zm52  (Road Network centrelines)                -> GeoJSON
  - bike_routes    vd4b-a4iv  (Bike Routes: on- and off-road)           -> GeoJSON
  - property_info  dkk9-cj3x  (Property Info: lot size / zoning /
                               year built, current year)                -> CSV
  - fire_events    7hsn-idqi  (Fire Response, current + historical)     -> CSV
  - fire_stations  b4y7-zhnz  (Fire Stations: 31 points)                -> CSV
  - gtfs_stops     4vt2-8zrq  (ETS GTFS: stops)                         -> CSV
  - gtfs_routes    d577-xky7  (ETS GTFS: routes)                        -> CSV
  - gtfs_trips     ctwr-tvrd  (ETS GTFS: trips, slim $select)           -> CSV
  - gtfs_stop_times greh-g7ac (ETS GTFS: stop times, slim $select)      -> CSV
  - gtfs_calendar_dates f2sy-bth7 (ETS GTFS: calendar dates)            -> CSV
  - permits        24uj-dj8v  (General Building Permits, slim $select)   -> CSV
  - schools_public 996c-239n  (EPSB School Locations)                   -> CSV
  - schools_catholic gfxq-u8uu (Edmonton Catholic Schools, current)      -> CSV
  - census_population_2021 eg3i-f4bj (2021 Federal Census: Population)   -> CSV

Mill rates (pwis-wc4c) are NOT fetched here — they live in the committed
``data/mill_rates.json`` (see DATA.md); refreshing them for a new year is a
manual, reviewed step because the year must align with the assessment roll.

Every download is verified against truncation two ways (see
docs/FINDINGS_data_integrity_audit.md, the $limit truncation risk):
  1. GeoJSON sources carry an explicit ``limit`` (the URL's $limit): Socrata
     truncates silently at $limit, returning exactly that many features, so a
     post-download count >= limit fails the run. Works offline; catches OUR
     limit going stale as a dataset grows.
  2. All sources carry a ``count_url`` ($select=count(*)): the post-download
     record count must equal the live server count exactly. Catches
     truncation by any limit that isn't ours — historically SODA 2.0 capped
     $limit at 50,000 server-side (this endpoint demonstrably doesn't today:
     roads returned 53,720 in one request, 2026-07-01), and a platform cap
     could (re)appear without touching our config. The count fetch itself
     fails SOFT (warn + proceed — the guard must not add fragility, same
     principle as check_year_alignment); a count MISMATCH fails hard.

Usage:
    python scripts/download_data.py                 # fetch all inputs
    python scripts/download_data.py --only zoning   # fetch one (repeatable)
