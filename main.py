"""End-to-end pipeline entrypoint for the Edmonton value-per-acre analysis.

Wires the independently-runnable ``src/`` modules together in order and produces
both project outputs from a single command:

    Phase 1  static choropleth PNG   -> output/edmonton_value_per_acre.png
    Phase 2  slim web GeoJSON         -> web/data/neighbourhood_value_per_acre.geojson

This module is the single place that pins the canonical export parameters
(SETBACK_M, SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE_M) in version-controlled code, rather than
leaving them in ad-hoc regen commands. See docs/PERFORMANCE.md for why those
values were chosen.

Usage:
    python main.py                      # run with the defaults below
    python main.py --skip-png           # web GeoJSON only (faster iteration)
    python main.py --assessment-csv ... # override any input/output path
