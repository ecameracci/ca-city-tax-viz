# Data Sources

Reference for raw input files. Update this file when you discover column name quirks, encoding issues, or anything unexpected. Do not rely on memory — write it down here.

**Socrata download completeness (applies to every source below):** Socrata
truncates silently at `$limit` — it returns exactly that many rows with no
error. Historically SODA 2.0 also imposed a **server-side 50,000-row cap** on
`$limit`; Edmonton's endpoints demonstrably don't today (the road network
returned 53,720 features in one request, 2026-07-01), but a platform cap could
(re)appear without touching our config. `scripts/download_data.py` therefore
verifies every download two ways: post-download count vs. **our** declared
`$limit` (fails at count >= limit), and vs. the **live server count** via
`$select=count(*)` (mismatch fails hard; an unreachable count endpoint only
warns — the guard must not add fragility). Verified against all four sources
2026-07-01.

## 0. Property Assessment Data (Historical) — CATALOGUED 2026-07-28, NOT YET USED

**Not in `download_data.py` and not in `data/raw/`.** Catalogued because the
shape was measured live and it unblocks the per-neighbourhood assessment-over-
time graph (`TODO.md`). Numbers below are from the API on 2026-07-28.

**Reportable evidence for the defect:** `notebooks/standalone/historical_2024_gap.py`
re-measures it live from the portal (no repo dependency) and is the artifact to
send with a data-quality report — it runs both detectors, shows the missing
accounts cluster into whole buildings, and lists account numbers Edmonton can
check by hand.

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `qi6a-xuwt` ("Property Assessment
Data (Historical)")
**Coverage:** **14 years, 2012–2025**, 5,501,958 rows total (337k in 2012 rising
to 432k in 2025 — the roll grows with the city).
**Columns:** same shape as the current roll (§1) — `account_number`,
`assessment_year`, `neighbourhood_name`, `assessed_value`, `mill_class_1`,
`tax_class_pct_1`, `lot_size`, `zoning`, `year_built`, `latitude`/`longitude`,
`point_location`.

**⚠️ Do NOT download this whole dataset — aggregate server-side.** It carries
`neighbourhood_name`, so Socrata can do the grouping:

```
https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/qi6a-xuwt.json
  ?$select=neighbourhood_name,assessment_year,sum(assessed_value) as total,count(1) as n
  &$group=neighbourhood_name,assessment_year
  &$limit=50000
```

**Measured:** 5,577 rows / **443 neighbourhoods** in **~3 s, 534 kB** of verbose
JSON. Re-shaped as array-of-arrays that is well under 100 kB before gzip.
Note `$limit=50000` is required — the default page size is 1,000, and 443×14
would silently truncate. (See §head for the historical 50,000-row server cap.)

**Known quirks:**
- **443 hoods here vs the current roll's count** — expect names that have since
  been renamed, merged, or annexed. Any join to the neighbourhood boundary file
  MUST go through the same normalization + `check_unmatched_names.py` policy as
  everything else; no silent drops.
- Some rows carry a null/blank `neighbourhood_name` (filtered in the count
  above) — they are not free to ignore, they need the same explicit flagging.
- **`mill_class_1` alone does not reconstruct revenue** — the current pipeline
  uses the full class/percentage split. Historical *rates* live in `pwis-wc4c`
  (§"Property and Education Tax Rates"), which starts **2014**, so a revenue
  series cannot reach back to 2012 even though value does.

## 1. Property Assessment Data

**File:** `data/raw/Property_Assessment_Data__Current_Calendar_Year_.csv` *(filename as delivered by the API)*
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py`
**Source:** [Edmonton Open Data](https://data.edmonton.ca/City-Administration/Property-Assessment-Data-Current-Calendar-Year-/q7d6-ambg) — dataset ID `q7d6-ambg`
**API URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/api/views/q7d6-ambg/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD`
**Format:** CSV, 439,769 rows. **Live feed, updated weekly** (Socrata
`Update Frequency: Weekly`); the assessment *year* rolls annually.
**Assessment year:** **2025** — i.e. effective 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31. The year
is **not a column in the rows**; it lives only in the dataset metadata
(`https://data.edmonton.ca/api/views/q7d6-ambg.json` → description /
`custom_fields.Time Frame.Period of Coverage`). Our local snapshot was downloaded
2026-05-16 and is 2025 data. **Re-check the metadata after any re-download** — a
later pull can roll to a new year, which would silently desync from any
year-matched mill rates (see `docs/SPEC_revenue.md`). **This re-check is now
automated in CI** (`scripts/check_year_alignment.py`, added 2026-07-01): every
scheduled refresh compares the metadata year against the pinned
`ASSESSMENT_YEAR` and holds (skip regen + banner) on mismatch.
**Re-download 2026-07-02** (deployment dry-run + first CI run): metadata still
effective **2025** (intra-year edits only, no year roll), so 2025 rates stay
aligned. That pull also surfaced a new `Assessment Class 1` label
`DESIGNATED IND PROPERTIES` (1 row) — mapped to Non Residential; see
`docs/FINDINGS_assessment_classes.md`.
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

### Columns (confirmed 2026-05-22)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `Account Number` | int64 | Unique property identifier |
| `Suite` | float64 | Mixed types — use `low_memory=False` on load |
| `House Number` | int64 | |
| `Street Name` | str | |
| `Neighbourhood ID` | int64 | Numeric neighbourhood key |
| `Neighbourhood` | str | Normalize (strip + uppercase) for joining |
| `Ward` | str | |
| `Assessed Value` | int64 | Main metric — 46 zero-value rows, 0 nulls (confirmed) |
| `Tax Class` | str | Values: Residential, Non Residential, Other Residential, Farmland |
| `Garage` | str | |
| `Assessment Class 1` | str | See values below — no explicit "exempt" flag |
| `Assessment Class 2` | float64 | |
| `Assessment Class 3` | float64 | |
| `Assessment Class % 1` | int64 | |
| `Assessment Class % 2` | float64 | |
| `Assessment Class % 3` | float64 | |
| `Latitude` | float64 | |
| `Longitude` | float64 | |
| `Point Location` | str | |

**Assessment Class 1 values:** RESIDENTIAL (411,563), COMMERCIAL (23,054), OTHER RESIDENTIAL (4,356), FARMLAND (509), MA DERELICT RESIDENTIAL (284), NONRES MUNICIPAL/RES EDUCATION (3)

**Tax-exempt flag:** No explicit exempt boolean. Best proxy is `Assessment Class 1 == 'NONRES MUNICIPAL/RES EDUCATION'` (3 rows). Flag these on load as `is_exempt`. So `is_exempt` cannot identify exempt-heavy neighbourhoods.

⚠️ **CORRECTED 2026-08-07 — institutional land is NOT uniformly absent from this roll, and the previous version of this line said it was.** It read: *"tax-exempt institutional land (Legislature, schools, hospitals, City property) is **absent from the taxable roll entirely**, not flagged or zeroed"* (noted 2026-06-29). Measured against the roll, that is **half right and half wrong**, and the wrong half is load-bearing:

- **Present.** Every major hospital is on the roll, and was before the Jul-6 snapshot: Royal Alexandra `11495590` $273.8M, Misericordia `11495573` $247.8M, Grey Nuns `11495606` $196.9M, Cross Cancer `11495587` $68.1M. The U of A campus is on it too — `11495614` $577.1M, `11495565` $437.7M, `9996778` $430.8M.
- **Absent.** The Alberta Legislature is genuinely not there (0 rows at 10800 97 AVENUE NW; no `LEGISLATURE` neighbourhood), so the original observation was true of provincial Crown land and got generalised.

**Sized by spatial join of all 439,685 parcels against `zoning.geojson`** (2026-08-07; 8 parcels matched no polygon). Parcels sitting on the four exempt-proxy zones:

| zone | | parcels | assessed | modelled levy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AJ` | Alternative Jurisdiction | 340 | $2,599,819,500 | $60.3M/yr |
| `UF` | Urban Facilities | 768 | $1,951,061,000 | $41.4M/yr |
| `UI` | Urban Institution | 39 | $690,542,500 | $15.7M/yr |
| `PU` | Public Utility | 1,107 | $380,635,000 | $8.0M/yr |
| | **total** | **2,254** | **$5,622,058,000** | **$125.4M/yr — 4.6% of the $2.71B citywide served total** |

⚠️ **What this does NOT establish.** Being on the assessment roll with an assessed value is **not** the same as being levied: this dataset publishes assessments and a `Tax Class`, it does not publish exemption status, and Alberta assesses some exempt property. The pipeline applies mill rates to every record here, so **whether that is correct for these 2,254 parcels is an open question** (`TODO.md`), not a settled defect. ⚠️ **Zoning is also not ownership** — `UF` and `PU` include privately-owned facilities.

⚠️ **HOW THE $125.4M/yr MUST BE DESCRIBED, whenever it is quoted (locked 2026-08-08).** It is a **gross modelled figure, not a revenue loss and not a foregone-revenue estimate**:

> **Gross modelled tax if every institutional/public-zoned parcel were fully taxable.** Alberta law exempts many of these properties (hospitals, universities, government land); the actual taxable share is not publicly known.

The failure mode this guards against is quoting it as "$125.4M the City doesn't collect", which asserts an exemption status **no public source states** and which our own data cannot support either way. ⚠️ **The direction of the error is unknown, not merely unquantified** — if the City levies these parcels the modelled figure is right, and if it exempts them the model *overstates* the hoods holding them. `docs/FINDINGS_revenue_scale.md` §5 states this and used to state the reverse.

**The one nearby external reference point, and its limits.** Alberta's **Grants in Place of Taxes (GIPOT)** program pays municipalities for **Government of Alberta** property, which is exempt from municipal taxation; the federal PILT equivalent covers correctional, RCMP and military property. ⚠️ **Three cautions before this is used as an anchor for the figure above:**
- ⚠️ **No dollar amount is verified.** The City's own GIPOT page publishes **no figure at all** — only the percentage history. A "$15.7M for 2021-22" figure has been circulated to this project; secondary reporting puts Edmonton's GIPOT "at $15 million per year", consistent in magnitude but **not a confirmation of that number, that year, or that scope**. Do not publish it until a primary source is in hand.
- ⚠️ **Any 2020–2024 receipt is a HALF payment.** Alberta cut GIPOT to **75% of the calculated amount in 2019, then 50% for 2020–2024**, restored to 75% in 2025 and **100% in 2026**. So a 2021-22 receipt is roughly **half** the assessed-tax equivalent, and reading it as one understates by ~2×.
- ⚠️ **Coverage is narrower than the four zones.** GIPOT is a Government of Alberta program; **universities, hospitals and non-profits are not the Government of Alberta** and appear to fall outside it — but the program page does not enumerate exclusions, so *that* is inference, not a sourced statement. GIPOT therefore cannot net off the $125.4M even if the dollar figure were confirmed.

⚠️ **AND ABSENCE FROM THIS ROLL IS OFTEN TRANSIENT, NOT STRUCTURAL** (established 2026-08-07, and it is why the "absent entirely" claim above looked true). **Every identifier in these datasets churns:**

| identifier | churns how | worked example |
|---|---|---|
| `Account Number` | **renumbered** | all four major hospitals moved into a new `114955xx` block at the 2025 roll; the old numbers vanish from the current roll and the new ones appear in **no year** of `qi6a-xuwt` |
| address | **re-addressed** | `WESTMOUNT SHOPPING CENTRE NW` no longer exists as a street name |
| `Neighbourhood` | **renamed** | OLIVER → WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN moved 12,237 parcels; a per-hood value comparison reads that as **−100%** |

**A property can therefore be missing from the published current roll while still existing and still being assessed.** Misericordia Community Hospital was continuously assessed 2012–2025 as account `10095840` (~$200–260M, always WEST MEADOWLARK PARK), was renumbered to `11495573`, and was **absent from `q7d6-ambg` until 2026-08-03** — during which the map understated that neighbourhood by ~$250M of assessed value. ⚠️ **The two datasets disagree about account numbers for the SAME assessment year 2025** (historical still says `10095840`, current says `11495573`), so **cross-dataset account-number joins are unreliable for renumbered parcels.**

⚠️ **Renumbering is ROUTINE.** Year-over-year in the historical roll, accounts vanish at **0.15%–0.37%/yr** (2023→2024 spikes to **0.91%, 3,893 accounts**). A vanished account number is not by itself a finding.

**Position is stable enough to MATCH, but not to CONVICT.** `tools/audit_roll_continuity.py` matches parcels by position, independently of all three churning identifiers; re-run 2026-08-30 against historical 2024, **1,457 of 426,913 parcels (0.34%) had no current match, $1.07B assessed** (supersedes 1,534 / $1.62B from 2026-08-07). ⚠️ **The "coordinates move under 2 m" figure is a four-hospital sample and does NOT generalize**: 121 parcels the position match called missing are on the current roll under the same account number, having moved a median **58 m** (max 559 m). The tool now acquits those by `account_number` — an identifier may **acquit** here even though it must never **match**, because acquitting can only remove false positives. ⚠️ Those 1,457 remain candidates, not verdicts, and an upper bound — demolitions, subdivisions and consolidations legitimately have no 1:1 successor. (`legal_description` — plan/block/lot — would be a better key and is immutable, but exists **only** in the historical roll, so it cannot join the two.)

⚠️ **Two artifacts rest on the retracted claim and are UNVERIFIED against this correction:** `docs/FINDINGS_exempt_institutional.md` and `tools/audit_exempt_institutional.py` proxy exempt land as *polygon acres − taxable lot acres*, which under-counts by exactly the parcels above; `docs/ANALYSIS_BACKLOG.md` §7 (closed 2026-07-09) rests on the same premise. The direction of the original concern still holds — revenue/acre understates neighbourhoods holding large exempt institutions — but its **magnitude is not what those documents state**. See also `docs/FINDINGS_revenue_scale.md` §4–5, written under the old premise.

### Known Quirks

- Condo units: multiple rows share one land parcel — this is expected and correct for this analysis
- `Suite` column has mixed types — always load with `low_memory=False`
- 46 rows have `Assessed Value == 0` — drop and flag count on load
- No explicit tax-exempt column; proxy is `Assessment Class 1 == 'NONRES MUNICIPAL/RES EDUCATION'`, which is near-empty (3 rows). ⚠️ **This bullet used to add "because exempt institutional land is absent from the roll" — that reason is RETRACTED, see the Tax-exempt flag note above.** The proxy is near-empty regardless, but hospitals and the U of A campus *are* on the roll and $5.6B of assessed value sits on exempt-proxy zoning. The near-zero-revenue tail is **low-coverage** land (river valley / undeveloped), not exempt. See `docs/FINDINGS_revenue_scale.md`.
- Assessment year is metadata-only, not in the rows (year = 2025; see Format note above) — pin it against the mill-rate year for the revenue phase

## 2. Property Info Dataset (Lot Size, Zoning, Year Built)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `dkk9-cj3x` ("Property Info - Current Calendar Year")
**API URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/dkk9-cj3x.json`
**Format:** SODA JSON API (no bulk CSV download confirmed; query via API)
**Rows:** 439,769 (confirmed 2026-05-27 — closely matches assessment CSV row count)
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

**Reference implementation:** `scripts/edmonton_property_api_stuff.py` — Python equivalents of the JS query functions from the open-property app (github.com/[author]/open-property), reverse-engineered to understand how lot_size is sourced.

### Columns (confirmed 2026-05-27)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `account_number` | str | Join key to assessment dataset (`q7d6-ambg`) |
| `house_number` | str | |
| `street_name` | str | |
| `legal_description` | str | |
| `zoning` | str | e.g. `RSF` — nullable |
| `lot_size` | str (numeric) | Pre-computed by city; **not geometry-derived**. Units: sq metres (confirmed — sample value 335 m² is a typical residential lot). 2,728 nulls (~0.6%). |
| `total_gross_area` | str | Building floor area |
| `year_built` | str | Nullable. **Loaded since 2026-07-17** (Development stock-age spikes): 418,368 of 439,685 rows (95.2%), range 1881–2026, zero non-numeric junk; every row with a year also has coordinates. Loader nulls values outside [1850, 2100] (plausibility window, `load_property_info.YEAR_BUILT_MIN/MAX`). |
| `garage` | str | |
| `neighbourhood_id` | str | Numeric key |
| `neighbourhood` | str | ALL CAPS — consistent with assessment data |
| `ward` | str | |
| `latitude` | str | |
| `longitude` | str | |
| `point_location` | GeoJSON Point | Single coordinate per property — **no parcel polygon** |

### Key Findings

- **`lot_size` is a city-provided field, not computed** — Edmonton supplies it directly via the API. No geometry math needed.
- **No parcel polygon geometry** — only a centroid point. Edmonton transferred parcel GIS data to AltaLIS in 2021; it's no longer freely available. Polygon boundaries require the neighbourhood boundary file (dataset `65fr-66s6`).
- **`lot_size` units are sq metres** — divide by 4046.86 to get acres. (~0.6% null — minor, flag on load)
- **`Total Gross Area` units are sq metres too** (confirmed 2026-07-07: the
  RESIDENTIAL-class median is 112.7 — a ~1,200 sq ft house). The water lens
  (`src/load_water.py`) uses it to estimate multi-res unit counts (90 m²
  gross/unit assumption); 1,018 of 4,353 OTHER RESIDENTIAL rows have
  null/zero values — those buildings drop from the water model, counted.
- **`Total Gross Area` is now loaded by `load_property_info` (as `gross_area`)
  for the Development Lens B FAR** (2026-07-13) — the built floor-area ratio
  suitability proxy: `far` = Σ `gross_area` (per unit, over eligible points) ÷
  deduped lot area per hood, computed in `build_hood_lot_acres` on the same
  dedupe as the lot-acre denominator. 27,202 rows (~6.2%) have null/zero
  `gross_area` (flagged on load). ⚠️ **A hood whose eligible rows record NO floor
  area gets `far = null`, NOT 0** (changed 2026-08-22): null and zero both mean
  "not recorded", and `far == 0` is the maximum-OPPORTUNITY end of the Infill
  scale, so summing the gap to 0 turned absent data into a finding. **16 of 410
  hoods** are null on the current snapshot — 12 already set-aside grey, 4 newly
  off the scale, of which one (EVERGREEN, 4 eligible rows) is residential.
  Sanity: FAR
  ranges DOWNTOWN 3.37 / WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN 1.89 / GARNEAU 1.53 (densest) down to ≈0
  at River Valley / Anthony Henday greenfield edges. Low FAR = underused. Ships
  in the neighbourhood geojson (`far`, SLIM). See `docs/SPEC_development.md`
  Lens B for the proxy decision + the low-FAR park/greenfield caveat.
- **Condo `lot_size` semantics are INCONSISTENT (confirmed 2026-07-04)** — at the
  3,002 lat/long points holding multiple units, `lot_size` is sometimes the parcel
  size duplicated on every unit (summing overcounts the land), sometimes per-unit
  apportioned shares (summing is correct), and sometimes null/zero (one 1,059-unit
  building has nulls on 1,051 of them). No flag distinguishes the regimes. This is
  why the Glass view's grid export divides by cell GROUND acres, not lot acres
  (`src/export_value_grid.py`). **Dedupe heuristic built + validated
  2026-07-05** — repeat-aware: repeated values < 1000 m² are per-unit shares
  (count each; a plain distinct-sum collapses townhouse complexes and fakes
  needles), ≥ 1000 m² are duplicated parcels (count once); majority-null
  multi-unit points ineligible (56 points / 0.52% of roll, reported); per-hood
  bound test passes 405/406 (PEMBINA the known outlier, enforced by
  `check_lot_acre_bounds`). Full numbers: `docs/FINDINGS_lot_dedupe.md`.
- **One lat/long per account concentrates large parcels onto a single point
  (quantified 2026-07-04)** — the coordinate is a centroid regardless of lot
  size, so any point-binned density map needles big lots: West Edmonton Mall
  is one account ($1.285B assessed, 433,592 m² lot) behind one point — in the
  100 m Glass grid that's the #1 cell citywide at $12.6M levy/acre, 2× the top
  downtown tower ($620M on 3,754 m²), even though per LOT acre the tower beats
  WEM ~50× ($612M vs $12M value/lot-acre). Citywide, lots > 1 ha are 5,524
  rows carrying ~18% of the $237.5B roll. The lot-acre denominator variant
  (TODO.md, PRIORITY) is the chosen correction.
- **Downloaded via `scripts/download_data.py --only property_info`** (added
  2026-07-04): full-CSV export endpoint, server count(*) cross-check; lands at
  `data/raw/Property_Info__Current_Calendar_Year_.csv`. Join to the assessment
  roll on `Account Number`: 100% coverage (439,685 rows both sides, 2026-07-04).
- **`zoning` column probed 2026-07-05 (for the stormwater lens,
  `docs/SPEC_utilities.md`):** null on 157,030 rows (35.71%); 78 distinct base
  codes (first token) among the rest, and they are **current Bylaw 20001
  vocabulary** (RS 146,567 / RSF 98,606 dominant — no legacy RF1-style codes in
  the top ranks). 98.2% of non-null rows use base codes that appear directly in
  EPCOR's runoff-coefficient table; the remainder are special-area codes (GLDF,
  PLD, SLD, BRH, …) needing explicit hand assignments. 282,655 rows (64.3%)
  have both non-null `zoning` and positive `lot_size`. Zone-null fallback:
  point-in-polygon against `fixa-tstc` (§5). Follow-ups from the build run:
  - The null `zoning` rows are almost all condo units at points where another
    row carries the zone: per POINT, only 4,509 of 287,163 lack any zone, and
    the `fixa-tstc` fallback resolves 4,508 of those (1 unresolved citywide).
  - **Three legacy old-bylaw codes linger** (1 point each): `US`, `CSC`, `RSL`
    — Bylaw 12800 vocabulary that never appears in `fixa-tstc`. Excluded +
    reported by `load_stormwater` (`ZONE_RUNOFF` covers current codes only).
  - **`Neighbourhood` contains two non-boundary names:** the known `OLIVER`
    straggler (1 row, zero lot) and `SPUR LINES` (1 row, 62.5 ha of IM-zoned
    rail-spur land, no boundary polygon) — both dropped + flagged at the
    stormwater join, immaterial by count.

### Architecture Decision — Phase 1

For Phase 1 (neighbourhood-level choropleth), two approaches are viable:

| Approach | How | Tradeoff |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **A — Boundary join** | Sum `assessed_value` by neighbourhood → join to boundary polygons → divide by polygon area | Requires `load_boundaries.py` + area calc; clean for mapping |
| **B — Parcel lot_size** | Join `dkk9-cj3x` to `q7d6-ambg` on `account_number` → sum `assessed_value` / sum `lot_size` by neighbourhood | Bypasses boundary file; condo duplication needs investigation first |

**Current plan: Approach A** (boundary join) — boundary file already downloaded, simpler data flow, no condo ambiguity. Revisit Approach B for Phase 2 if parcel-level detail is needed.

**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` (fetches this alongside assessment + zoning; uses `$limit=500`, which covers all 407)
**Format:** GeoJSON, 2.9 MB
**Features:** 407 neighbourhoods
**Geometry type:** MultiPolygon (all features)
**CRS:** EPSG:4326 (WGS84) — reproject to EPSG:3400 before area calculation
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

### Columns (confirmed 2026-05-27)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `neighbourhood_number` | str | Numeric neighbourhood key |
| `name` | str | ALL CAPS — use as `neighbourhood_name` join key |
| `descriptive_name` | str | Human-readable name (may differ from `name`) |
| `civic_ward_name` | str | Ward name |
| `district` | str | District name |
| `effective_start_date` | str | |
| `effective_end_date` | str | |
| `description` | str | |
| `geometry` | MultiPolygon | Boundary polygon |

### Known Quirks

- `name` is already ALL CAPS — matches our `neighbourhood_name` normalization convention
- 407 boundary features. Join outcome (after the 2026-07-01 audit corrections): 1 assessment neighbourhood with no boundary match (the immaterial `OLIVER` straggler, $500 — deliberately unmapped) and 1 boundary neighbourhood with no assessment data (`LEWIS FARMS`) → 406 of 407 boundaries rendered. See "Name Matching" below; flagged in `join_and_calculate.py`.
- ⚠️ **THIS FILE DOES TILE THE CITY — the earlier "14% has no neighbourhood" reading was a DISPLAY ARTIFACT, corrected 2026-08-09.** Measured in `EPSG:3400`: the 406 rendered hoods cover **782.0 km²** in this raw file (all 407 = **782.11**), against a legal boundary polygon of **782.38 km²**. They agree to **1.4 km²** — the raw fabric tiles Edmonton. What the 2026-08-08 note measured as a "109.6 km² gap" was `main.py`'s **`SETBACK_M = 45.0`** inward display buffer: **all 406** hoods shrink (median **18.3%**, min 2.7%, max 65.9%), and `buffer(-45)` + `simplify(10)` reproduces the shipped file's **672.42 km²** exactly. See §14.

### Served precision of `neighbourhood_value_per_acre.geojson` (2026-08-09)

⚠️ **The served file is rounded to 5 dp of coordinate and 6 significant figures
of attribute** (`WEB_PRECISION` / `WEB_SIGNIFICANT_FIGURES` in
`join_and_calculate.py`, applied as GDAL `COORDINATE_PRECISION` /
`SIGNIFICANT_FIGURES` at write time). **This is a served-payload decision, not a
computation change**: `export_geojson` returns the full-precision frame, and every
number is computed at full precision upstream.

Why it is a data-contract fact and not a formatting detail: **this file is fetched
at boot, before the map can draw data, by every visitor whatever lens they use** —
it is the one payload whose size grows with the number of lenses, because each
lens adds per-hood columns here. At 66 columns the attributes had already grown
larger than the geometry (176 KB vs 138 KB gzipped). GDAL's 15-digit default was
**half the gzipped payload**: 340 KB → 166 KB.

⚠️ **Anything reading this file for ANALYSIS now sees 6 significant figures** —
`tools/ward_rollup.py`, `ml_feature_importance.py`, `audit_outlier_tails.py` and
four others do. Six figures is far past what any of them need, but a *figure about
the world* should still come from `data/raw/`, for the reason §14 records.

## 4. Property and Education Tax Rates (revenue phase)

**File:** `data/mill_rates.json` *(curated extract — see provenance inside)*
**Source:** [Edmonton Open Data](https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/pwis-wc4c.json) — dataset ID `pwis-wc4c` ("Property and Education Tax Rates (2014 onward)")
**Format:** Socrata JSON/SODA API (live; updated annually — 2026 rates published 2026-04-29, and **PRE-STAGED in `mill_rates.json` since 2026-08-06**, inert until `ASSESSMENT_YEAR` rolls)
**Units:** amount per **$1,000** of assessed value (mills); also published per-dollar
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

Columns: `tax_year`, `tax_rate_type` (Municipal / Education / Education Requisition Allowance), `assessment_class`, `amount_per_1_000_of_assessed_value`, `amount_per_dollar_of_assessed_value`.

**2025 Municipal rates (per $1,000)** — the year matching our assessment snapshot:

| Tax Class | Municipal mill rate |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Residential | 7.6254 |
| Other Residential | 8.3116 |
| Non Residential | 24.2229 |
| Farmland | 7.6254 *(assumed = Residential — see quirks)* |

Non-residential is ~3.2× residential — this class differential is the basis of the revenue phase (`docs/SPEC_revenue.md`).

### Known Quirks

- **Join on assessment `Tax Class`** (clean 4-value field). Rate-table class names use spaces (`Non Residential`); some historical years use a hyphenated `Non-Residential` — normalize on load.
- **No 2025 Farmland rate published.** The source dropped a separate Farmland class in 2025. Municipal Farmland == Municipal Residential in every year 2014–2024, so `mill_rates.json` sets 2025 Farmland municipal = Residential (7.6254) as a **flagged assumption**, not authoritative. Low impact (509 farmland parcels).
  - ⚠️ **That assumption is now ON SCREEN** (2026-08-01): the mill-rate pod prints "Farmland rate assumed" beside the rates. It is driven by the **`_assumed` key in this file**, which `generate_status.py` turns into a list in `status.json` — so **adding a real 2025+ Farmland row with no `_assumed` key silently and correctly retires the caveat**. Do not delete the key to "clean up"; deleting it claims the rate was published.
- ⚠️ **This file now feeds the FRONT END, not just the pipeline** (2026-08-01). `generate_status.py` copies the current year's municipal rates into `web/data/status.json` as `municipal_rates`, which the mill-rate pod renders. Rates are never typed into `web/index.html`. Consequence for the January roll: adding a year here is still the single edit, but the committed `status.json` only picks it up when the refresh runs — `tests/test_generate_status.py` asserts the committed manifest matches what the generator would write, so a drift fails the suite rather than shipping stale rates.
- Rate-type label changed over time: older years (2014–2018) use `Municipal Tax Rate` / `Education Tax Rate`; 2019+ use `Municipal` / `Education`. Only 2019+ form is needed for 2025.
- `Mature Area Derelict Residential` and `Transitional Residential` exist as rate classes but not as assessment `Tax Class` values — unused by the Tax-Class join.
- **Two class vocabularies in the assessment CSV.** `Tax Class` (col 9) is the clean 4-value field used for the join. The `Assessment Class 1/2/3` (+ `% 1/2/3`) columns describe split-class parcels using *different* labels (`COMMERCIAL` = `Non Residential`, plus `MA DERELICT RESIDENTIAL` → Non Residential, `NONRES MUNICIPAL/RES EDUCATION` → exempt). `map(Assessment Class 1)` equals `Tax Class` in 100% of rows, so only the 2nd/3rd slices add information; split-class is rare (~0.25% of rows). Full label→rate-class map, counts, and the unified levy formula: `docs/FINDINGS_assessment_classes.md`.

### Residential-revenue decomposition (added 2026-07-16)

`apply_tax_rates.py` also emits **`res_levy`** — the subset of each parcel's levy
billed on **`RESIDENTIAL` + `OTHER RESIDENTIAL`** class slices (all housing:
houses/condos <4 units *and* 4+ unit apartment buildings; split-class parcels
contribute only their residential slice). **`MA DERELICT RESIDENTIAL` is
excluded** — the city deliberately bills it at the punitive Non Residential
rate, so its dollars are non-residential-rate dollars. Flows: `res_levy` →
`total_res_revenue` (aggregate) → **`res_revenue_per_acre`** /
**`res_revenue_per_lot_acre`** (slim GeoJSON; the lot variant inherits the
LOW_PARCEL_FRAC suppression). No share column ships — the client derives the
residential share as `res_revenue_per_acre / revenue_per_acre` (identical
denominators cancel). Real-data anchors (2025 roll): residential-class =
**52.6% of the citywide levy**; hood median share ~75%, DOWNTOWN ~16%; ground
p97.5 ≈ $28.5k/acre (web clamp $30k). Distinct from `is_residential`
(§ Residential split below), which is a *zoned-area* display flag, not dollars.

**Glass grid variant (added 2026-07-17):** `export_value_grid.py` rolls the
same `res_levy` into the 100 m cells — payload columns
**`res_revenue_per_acre`** / **`res_revenue_per_lot_acre`** appended after the
existing six (`value_grid.json` ~1.76 → ~2.1 MB raw; Pages gzips). A cell with
assessed property but no residential-class levy reads a **real 0**, not null
(distinct from "no cell" = no property); lot slots stay null where no eligible
lot acres, exactly like value/revenue. ~79% of cells have res > 0; res ≤ rev
per cell (±$1 whole-dollar rounding). Older files lack the columns and the
Glass Residential $ metric falls back to hood prisms (web column guard).

### Non-residential decomposition (added 2026-07-18 — SPEC_industrial.md A1)

`apply_tax_rates.py` also emits **`nonres_levy`** — the subset of each parcel's
levy billed **at the Non Residential rate**: `COMMERCIAL` + `MA DERELICT
RESIDENTIAL` + `DESIGNATED IND PROPERTIES` slices (`NONRES_RATE_LABELS`,
derived from the label→rate-class map so a future non-res label can't be
missed). The complement of `res_levy` by rate class; farmland (its own rate
class, 509 parcels) is the only slice in neither subset, so the identity
**`levy == res_levy + nonres_levy + farmland slices`** holds exactly (tested).
Flows mirror res: `nonres_levy` → `total_nonres_revenue` →
**`nonres_revenue_per_acre`** / **`nonres_revenue_per_lot_acre`** (slim
GeoJSON, LOW_PARCEL_FRAC suppression inherited) and into the 100 m cells
(payload columns appended LAST, after `median_year_built`; real-0/null
conventions identical to res; `value_grid.json` ~2.28 → ~2.50 MB raw). NOTE
there is **no industrial-vs-commercial split in the roll** — `COMMERCIAL`
covers all non-res (§ 2) — so this is the honest class-complete cut; an
industrial-only cut would need a zoning join. Real-data anchors (2025 roll):
non-res-rate = **47.4% of the citywide levy** ($1.281B of $2.704B; farmland
residual ~$532K); 34% of grid cells have nonres > 0; hood ground p97.5 ≈
$48.4k/acre (web clamp $50k). Web: fourth Money metric ("Non-res $"),
column-guarded like Residential $.

**Stock-age grid column (added 2026-07-17):** `export_value_grid.py` also
rolls `year_built` (property-info, § 2) into **`median_year_built`** per 100 m
cell — appended LAST in the payload columns; whole-year ints. Median over
ROWS (unit-weighted), which makes the multi-unit duplication regimes moot: a
tower repeating one year on every unit row medians to that year, no dedupe
machinery. A cell where **no property has a known year carries `null`, never
0** — age has no meaningful zero ("year 0" would be a lie; contrast
`res_levy`'s real $0). Consumed by the **Development view's Spikes picker**
("Year built" — height + colour linear in year, recency bright), NOT by
Glass; it rides in this file because the age layer needs the whole-roll cell
population, which `dev_grid.json` (permit cells only) doesn't have. Older
files lack the column and the picker stays hidden.

**Institutional-share grid column (added 2026-08-19):** `export_value_grid.py`
also rolls **`inst_frac`** — the share of a cell's levy sitting on
**institutionally-zoned** land — appended LAST in the payload columns. Source
is `revenue_by_zone`'s per-property zoning category, which used to be an
internal step and is now `property_zone_categories`; `main.py` computes it
**once** and attaches `inst_levy` to the assessment frame, so the hood
`rev_frac_inst` and the cell `inst_frac` come from the SAME point-in-polygon
pass and cannot drift. ⚠️ **A SHARE, not a per-acre column, and there is
deliberately no `_lot` sibling** — which land is institutional is a fact about
the land, so the one fraction serves both denominators, exactly as
`rev_frac_inst` already does at hood level. A cell with **no levy to
apportion carries `null`, never 0** (same rule as `res_levy`'s real-$0
contrast: "nothing to apportion" is not "0% institutional"). Rounded to 4
decimals — a display gate, not an accounting figure; ⚠️ that rounding is
load-bearing at the top end, where a 99.95% cell keeps a real (invisible)
levied residual and only an **exactly 1.0** cell collapses its base to zero.
Real-data anchors (**the shipped 2026-08-19 refresh**, 34,666 cells): citywide
institutional share of levy **4.8%**; **623 cells (1.8%) at or above the 0.25
display threshold, carrying 4.9% of city levy**; of the 714 cells above 10%,
**467 are above 99%** — the distribution is bimodal, which is why the Glass band
needs only one threshold where the hood treatment needed two. (The design was
measured on a local 2026-08-09 roll giving 624 of 34,671; ⚠️ **the set moves
with the roll**, so re-measure rather than citing these as fixed.) Flagged cells are
lower on average (median $9,261/acre vs $18,127) but heavier at the top (p90
$97,610 vs $53,673), and **18 of the city's top 100 cells by $/acre are
flagged**, the tallest at **$5.66M/acre, 100% institutional**. Consumed by the
**Glass view's uncertainty bands** (revenue cuts only). Older files lack the
column and the bands simply do not draw.

## 5. Zoning Bylaw Geographical Data (land-use layer, added 2026-06-29)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `fixa-tstc` ("Zoning Bylaw Geographical Data")
**Download URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/fixa-tstc.geojson?$limit=20000`
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` (fetches this alongside assessment + boundaries)
**Format:** GeoJSON, ~9.2 MB
**Features:** 11,510 zoning polygons (MultiPolygon)
**CRS:** CRS84 / EPSG:4326 — reproject to EPSG:3400 before any overlay/area
**Vintage:** the **2024 Zoning Bylaw** (new codes, e.g. `RSF` = "Small Scale Flex
Residential"). Assessment is 2025 — close enough; zoning is stable. Record the
download date / `date_ext` for provenance.

**Why:** neighbourhood-level aggregation needs explicit categorization of
non-developable land (River Valley, parks, undeveloped) that parcel-level analysis
handles implicitly. Overlaid on neighbourhood boundaries → land-use composition %
per neighbourhood → drives the colour-scale set-aside. See `SPEC_revenue.md`
(Update 2026-06-29) and `FINDINGS_revenue_scale.md`.

### Columns (confirmed 2026-06-30)
| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `zoning` | zone code, e.g. `RSF`, `A`, `RM h16` — height/overlay suffixes appended; parse the **first token** for the base code |
| `description` | human-readable, e.g. "River Valley", "Small Scale Flex Residential" |
| `url` | link to the bylaw page. **The path encodes the authoritative bylaw section** — `…/part-2-…/residential-zones/…`, `…/industrial-zones/…`, `…/open-space-and-urban-services-zones/…`, `…/agricultural-zones/…`, plus `…-special-area` groups. Use as an independent **cross-check** when building the code→category dict (see quirks), NOT as the category itself (groups are mixed — see below) |
| `dc2_sub_area` | sub-area for `DC2` site-specific zones |
| `date_ext` | extract timestamp (e.g. `2026-06-29 02:07:03`) — record for provenance |
| `id`, `agreement_no` | record identifiers |
| `geometry` | polygon (Socrata source field `geometry_multipolygon`; geopandas reads it as `geometry`) |

### Known Quirks
- **Geometry needs cleaning before overlay.** Raw polygons are invalid/mixed-dimension
  → geopandas `overlay` raises `GEOSException`. Fix: `buffer(0)`, drop empty + keep
  only Polygon/MultiPolygon parts.
- **Do NOT categorize by keyword/prefix.** "Energy & Technology **Park**" is industrial,
  "Century **Park**" is a TOD redevelopment — the word "Park" ≠ green park. The `A*`
  codes are mostly River Valley special areas (Hawrelak, Muttart) but `AED` =
  Arena/Entertainment District (downtown), `ALA` = Ambleside apartments. Use an
  **explicit `code → category` dictionary** (exactly **95 base codes** confirmed
  2026-06-30; `description` + `url` make each obvious). Lives in `src/load_zoning.py`.
- **`url` cross-check (confirmed 2026-06-30).** The `url` path's bylaw section is a
  useful *verification* signal but is NOT a drop-in category — groups mix set-aside and
  developed codes. The `open-space-and-urban-services-zones` group is the clearest case:
  it contains set-aside `A`/`NA`/`PS`/`PSN` **and** developed infrastructure `PU` (Public
  Utility), `UF` (Urban Facilities), `UI` (Urban Institution), `AJ` (Alternative
  Jurisdiction). Categorize at the code level; use `url` only to catch dict errors (e.g.
  it correctly resolves the `A*` trap: `AED`→`downtown-special-area`, `ALA`/`AUVC`→
  `ambleside-special-area`, not river valley).
- **Direct Control zones (`DC`, `DC1`, `DC2`) — confirmed 2026-06-30.** ~1,081 rows are
  site-specific / special-area zones with no standard `/part-N/` bylaw section in `url`
  (`DC*`, plus named zones like Blatchford, Century Park, River Crossing). **Rule:**
  `DC`/`DC1`/`DC2` default to **developed** (stay on scale — conservative, won't wrongly
  hide land). Named-natural special-area codes (`NSRVES`, `A7` Hawrelak, etc.) are caught
  by their own explicit dict entry, not by the `DC` default.
- **`url = "legacy"` sentinel (confirmed 2026-07-07).** 44 polygons (611 ha) carry the
  literal string `legacy` in `url` instead of a bylaw-page path — pre-2024-Bylaw zones
  (mostly bare `DC`, some special-area) never migrated to the per-provision page system.
  There is **no page to scrape** for these, and the bare-`DC` ones also lack an
  `agreement_no`, so they are unclassifiable from this dataset alone (distinct from the
  ~19 unpublished provision pages that 403). The DC-use pipeline (`ANALYSIS_BACKLOG` item
  3) rolls them up as `frac_dc_unknown`; the largest single one (id `173291`, 50 ha) is
  West Edmonton Mall, geometrically coincident with the migrated `dc2-1198` polygon.
- **Set-aside categories:** never = River Valley (`A`,`NA`)/Parks (`PS`,`PSN`); not-yet
  = Future (`FD`)/rural (`AG`,`RR`)/industrial reserve (`EET*`). Institutional
  (`UI`,`UF`,`AJ`,`PU`) is a proxy for where exempt-roll understatement lives.
- **Residential split (added 2026-07-01, for the residential-only lens).** The developed
  bucket is split by each code's `description` into `res` (primary permitted use is
  housing — the `RS*`/`RM`/`RL`/`HDR`/`RMU` standard zones + special-area row-housing /
  apartment / low-density codes, e.g. `GRH`, `BLMR`, `SRH`, `CCLD`) and the
  non-residential group. `is_residential` = `frac_residential` ≥ **0.50** of *zoned*
  area (a display filter, **orthogonal to** `is_set_aside` — the two can't both be
  true since fractions sum to 1). Per-code assignments live in `src/load_zoning.py`.
- **Non-residential split (added 2026-07-03, for the use-mix view).** The old `nonres`
  bucket is split four ways: `com` (commercial/retail/entertainment, 14 codes),
  `ind` (industrial/warehousing/business employment, 7), `mix` (mixed use, 14), and
  `dc` (Direct Control — bespoke per-site bylaws, no single use claimable; 24% of
  nonres area so it can't honestly fold into another bucket). **Names mislead —
  ambiguous codes were resolved from the bylaw page's purpose statement (the `url`
  field):** `UW` "Urban Warehouse" is a downtown *mixed-use* zone, not warehousing;
  `BE` "Business Employment" sits in the bylaw's *industrial-zones* part; `HA`
  Heritage Area and `MMS` Marquis Main Street are mixed (ground-floor retail +
  res/office above); `MED`/`AED` entertainment districts are commercial. Unknown
  codes now default to `other` (on scale, claimed as no specific use, flagged
  loudly) instead of `nonres`. `frac_other` = 0 on current data (all 95 codes
  mapped). ⚠️ **There is no aggregate non-residential column.** `frac_nonres`
  (com+ind+mix+dc+other) was removed 2026-08-31 — nothing consumed it and it
  never reached the served GeoJSON, and it was the one place unclassified land
  was asserted as a non-residential use. The monthly digest reports a non-zero
  `frac_other` (`docs/RUNBOOK.md` §0) since a new bylaw code only WARNS.
- **Refresh requirement:** re-pull each pipeline cycle so developing land (rezoned
  FD/AG → residential) graduates off the set-aside list automatically.

## 6. Road Network (road supply layer, added 2026-07-01)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `9j8t-zm52` ("Road Network")
**Download URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/9j8t-zm52.geojson?$limit=100000`
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` → `data/raw/roads.geojson` (gitignored)
**Format:** GeoJSON, ~62 MB — centreline **LineStrings**, no surface polygons
**Features:** 53,720 segments (confirmed vs `count(*)` 2026-07-01)
**CRS:** EPSG:4326 — reproject to EPSG:3400 before any length calculation

**Why:** the services lens (`docs/SPEC_services.md`) — city-maintained road
length per neighbourhood, the first cost-side metric. Consumed by
`src/load_roads.py`; the shipped metric is **collector + local metres per
boundary acre** (`road_m_per_acre`).

### Key columns
| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `centerline_type` | `Road` 39,515 / `Alley` 12,088 / `Railway` 2,117 — **filter to `Road`** |
| `responsible_party_description` | City of Edmonton 49,794; Province 1,164 (ring road); CN/CP rail; Private 566; neighbouring municipalities — **filter to `City of Edmonton`** |
| `functional_class_code` | closed enumeration, 15 values (4 Arterial classes, Collector/Local by adjoining land use, `Local-ParkWay`, `Local-Private`, `Alley-Residential`) — explicit dict `CLASS_GROUP` in `load_roads.py` |
| `geometry` | LineString centrelines |

### Known Quirks
- **Null `functional_class_code` = Alley + Railway exactly** (14,205 = 12,088 +
  2,117, verified 2026-07-01). After the Road + City filters every row is
  classified — a null/unknown there means upstream drift (`load_roads` warns
  loudly and defaults to `local` so the length stays in the metric).
- **41 Road-type rows are functionally classed `Alley-Residential`** (all
  City-owned, 5.7 km). Excluded per the alleys-out decision — function
  governs, not `centerline_type` (SPEC_services.md).
- **`Local-Private` ≠ privately owned:** 73 of the 376 `Local-Private` rows are
  `responsible_party = City of Edmonton` and survive the ownership filter —
  kept as `local` (responsibility governs, not the name).
- **Arterials are computed but excluded from `road_m_total`** (shared
  infrastructure — SPEC_services.md; don't re-litigate). ~0.28% of filtered
  length falls outside all neighbourhood polygons (conservation guard reports
  it every run).
- **Vintage:** live feed like the others; no year semantics of its own (the
  network changes continuously, not per roll year). Refresh weekly with the
  other inputs.

## 7. Fire Response Events (fire lens, added 2026-07-06)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `7hsn-idqi` ("Fire Response: Current and Historical")
**Download URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/7hsn-idqi.csv?$limit=2000000`
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` → `data/raw/fire_response.csv` (gitignored)
**Format:** CSV via the SODA resource endpoint (snake_case API headers)
**Rows:** 948,086 dispatched events, 2011–mid-2026 (pulled 2026-07-06); ~90k/yr in the 2023–2025 window — the long-run ~65k/yr average understates current volume
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

**Why:** the fire lens (`docs/SPEC_services.md` "Fire lens") — dispatched
emergency events per neighbourhood per year, the first *demand*-side
service. Consumed by `src/load_fire.py`; the shipped metric is
**`fire_events_per_acre`** (mean annual kept events over the pinned
`FIRE_YEARS` window ÷ boundary acres).

### Key columns (headers confirmed on the first real pull, 2026-07-06; counts from the Session-12 probe)
| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `dispatch_datetime` | **confirmed** — resolves as the first exact candidate in `DISPATCH_COLUMN_CANDIDATES` (the resolver + substring fallback + hard error stay as drift insurance). Only 186 of 948k rows unparseable. |
| `event_close_datetime` + `event_duration_mins` | dispatch→CLOSE, i.e. incident length. **There is NO on-scene-arrival timestamp anywhere** — a true response-time metric is NOT buildable from this data (confirmed against the full column list) |
| `event_type_group` | **two-letter CODES** (MD, AL, TA, OF, CA, FR, HZ, TM…), NOT the long names the Session-12 probe showed — those live in `event_description`. ~1k rows over 15 years are code-only with a null description (DR 762, `86` 165, FP 83, HO 47, `88` 1) — kept under the bare code. |
| `event_description` | the long-name vocabulary (one-to-one with the codes): MEDICAL 57% (536k), ALARMS 144k, MOTOR VEHICLE INCIDENT 65k, OUTSIDE FIRE 48k, CITIZEN ASSIST 36k, FIRE 24k, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 20k, OTHER 10k, RESCUE 7k, VEHICLE FIRE 5k, MESS 137, PERMIT-BURNING OR OTHER 10, + operational noise (TRAINING/MAINTENANCE 18k, COMMUNITY EVENT 2.5k, PRE-INCIDENT PLANNING 515, 31k both-null). **`load_fire` filters on this column** (bare-code fallback). |
| `response_code` | dispatch-priority letters (D 446k, AL, NF, C, B, SR, E…) — **undecoded; never filter on it** |
| `neighbourhood_name` | **pre-joined on ~99% of rows** (8,093 null over the full history) — the per-hood metric needs no spatial work |
| lat/long | present; unused by the lens (locked: no spatial fallback) |

### Known Quirks
- **The 57% MEDICAL share is the interpretive trap** — the metric is
  fire-department *demand*, mostly medical calls, not fires. Legend/blurb
  caveat by locked decision, never a filter.
- Live feed (current + historical); the metric window is pinned
  (`FIRE_YEARS` in `main.py`, last 3 FULL years) so weekly refreshes don't
  average in a partial year. Bump each January (blurb + legend years in
  `web/index.html` ride along).
- `load_fire` HARD-ERRORS if a window year has zero rows (wrong pin or
  upstream drift) and keeps-but-logs group vocabulary outside
  `KNOWN_GROUPS`. **The Session-12 probe read `event_description` values,
  not `event_type_group`** — the first real pull (2026-07-06) caught the
  original code filtering on the wrong column via exactly that unknown-
  vocabulary warning (the noise filter matched nothing, MEDICAL logged 0%).
- **Hood names lag the boundary file** — `FIRE_NAME_CORRECTIONS` in
  `src/load_fire.py` layers fire-specific fixes on top of the shared
  `NAME_CORRECTIONS`: `OLIVER → WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN` (the fire CSV still uses the
  old name; 1,476 events/yr — 5th-highest hood, displayed as 0 until the
  first production refresh caught it), plus `KESWICK/MCCONACHIE/WINDERMERE
  AREA` → their boundary hoods. Kept out of the shared dict because the
  assessment side's OLIVER straggler is deliberately unmapped (see "Name
  Matching"). Legitimately unmatched leftovers (~18 events/yr, flagged at
  the join): COREYLAND, EDMONTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, UNKNOWN, RURAL SOUTH
  EAST — no boundary polygon exists for them.

## 8. Fire Stations (fire lens context dots, added 2026-07-06)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `b4y7-zhnz` ("Fire Stations")
**Download URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/b4y7-zhnz.csv?$limit=500`
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` → `data/raw/fire_stations.csv` (gitignored)
**Rows:** 31 — station number, address, lat/long point ONLY (no
staffing/coverage/response data; probed 2026-07-05).
Exported by `load_fire.export_fire_stations_web` to
`web/data/fire_stations.json` (committed) as `{"stations": [[lon, lat,
label], …]}` — context dots in the Services view, not a coverage claim.
Column resolution uses the same explicit-candidates rule as §7.

## 9. ETS GTFS Static Feed (transit lens, added 2026-07-11)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — the GTFS static feed published as FIVE
individual Socrata tables (the "zipped files" dataset `urjq-fvmq` is an
href-only landing page, no machine-readable blob; the `yiem-dcbw` "GTFS
Downloads" dataset is download-count *stats*, not the feed):

| Table | Dataset | Rows (2026-07-11) | Downloaded to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stops | `4vt2-8zrq` | 6,882 | `data/raw/gtfs_stops.csv` |
| Routes | `d577-xky7` | 238 | `data/raw/gtfs_routes.csv` |
| Trips | `ctwr-tvrd` | 56,812 | `data/raw/gtfs_trips.csv` |
| Stop Times | `greh-g7ac` | 1,744,051 | `data/raw/gtfs_stop_times.csv` |
| Calendar Dates | `f2sy-bth7` | 9,248 | `data/raw/gtfs_calendar_dates.csv` |
| LRT Routes | `rpjw-4jft` | 4 | `data/raw/lrt_routes.geojson` |

**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` (all gitignored). Trips and
stop_times use `$select` for only the keyed columns — trips otherwise
carries a per-trip `geometry_line` that dominates the file; stop_times
needs only `trip_id,stop_id` (31.6 MB slimmed). `$select` doesn't change
the row count, so both truncation guards still apply. LRT Routes is a
small GeoJSON (4 features), a separate 6th input feeding only the track-line
context layer — the metric runs without it.
**Why:** the transit lens (`docs/SPEC_services.md` "Transit lens") —
mean-weekday scheduled stop-events per neighbourhood. Consumed by
`src/load_transit.py`; the shipped metric is **`transit_dep_per_acre`**.

### Key columns
| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| stops: `stop_id`, `stop_lat`/`stop_lon`, `location_type` | types: 0 stop/platform (6,673), 1 station (58 — LRT stations + transit centres, the context-dot export), 2 entrance (109), 3 node (42). **The feed includes REGIONAL stops** (Spruce Grove, St. Albert park-and-rides etc.) — they fall outside every hood polygon and land in the reported unassigned bucket (~5.8% of stop-events, 2026-07-11). |
| routes: `route_id`, `route_type_descr` | "Bus" 235 / "Tram, Streetcar, Light rail" 3 — the explicit `ROUTE_MODE` dict in `load_transit.py`; unknown values kept as `other`, logged. |
| trips: `trip_id`, `route_id`, `service_id` | plain join keys. |
| stop_times: `trip_id`, `stop_id` | one row = one scheduled stop-event; only these two columns downloaded. |
| calendar_dates: `service_id`, `date`, `exception_type` | **calendar-dates-only feed** — every active service day is an `exception_type` 1 row (no calendar.txt); type-2 removals honoured generically if they ever appear. |
| lrt_routes: `lrt_route_id`, `lrt_route_name`, `lrt_route` (multiline) | **Not part of the metric — a map context layer only.** Four route multilines: 021R Capital, 022R Metro, 023R Valley, and `HER` (High Level Bridge heritage streetcar). `export_transit_lines_web` **drops HER** (`EXCLUDED_LRT_ROUTE_IDS` — volunteer-run, not ETS LRT service, absent from the GTFS routes counted) and flattens the rest to `web/data/lrt_lines.json` (343 segments, 2026-07-11). |

### Known Quirks
- **The feed is a snapshot of the CURRENT signup only** — probed window
  2026-06-18 → 2026-08-29 (the SUMMER schedule, the seasonal low).
  Weekly refreshes will step the metric at signup boundaries. No roll-year
  semantics; provenance = download date + the window logged every load.
- **No ridership anywhere:** the portal's `sfwk-p9kr`/`77dh-qrp7` (on-time
  %) and `wh9u-ef4x` (revenue vehicle hours) are citywide-monthly only
  (probed 2026-07-11) — no stop/route/neighbourhood usage exists. The lens
  is scheduled supply and must be labelled as such.
- **On-demand transit zones are not in the GTFS** (238 fixed routes only) —
  invisible to the metric; documented limitation for the on-demand fringe.
- ~253 service_ids (~20.6k trips, 2026-07-11) are weekend/holiday-only —
  they weigh 0 in the weekday metric by construction, logged not dropped.

## 10. Building Permits (development & infill lens A, added 2026-07-12)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data — dataset ID `24uj-dj8v` ("General Building Permits")
**Download URL:** `https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/24uj-dj8v.csv?$select=year,issue_date,work_type,building_type,units_added,neighbourhood,latitude,longitude&$limit=1000000`
*(latitude/longitude added 2026-07-15 for the 100 m detail grid —
`load_permits.export_dev_grid` → `web/data/dev_grid.json`; see the
geocoding-lag quirk below.)*
**Download:** `scripts/download_data.py` → `data/raw/building_permits.csv` (gitignored)
**Format:** CSV via the SODA resource endpoint, **slim `$select`** — only the 6
filter/join/numerator columns (the full schema is 34 cols; we skip
`construction_value`, `geometry_point`, `zoning`, `floor_area`, etc.). `$select`
does not change the row count, so both truncation guards still apply.
**Rows:** 243,371 permits, `issue_date` 2009-01-05 → present (pulled 2026-07-12)
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – City of Edmonton

**Why:** the Development & Infill lens A (`docs/SPEC_development.md`) — new
dwelling units built per neighbourhood, the project's first *change/flow* metric
(everything else describes the roll as it stands today). Consumed by
`src/load_permits.py`; the default metric is **`new_units_per_acre`** (Σ
`units_added` on new-construction ∩ residential permits over the pinned
`PERMIT_YEARS` window ÷ boundary acres). A second metric **`new_permits_per_acre`**
(permit count ÷ boundary acres, added 2026-07-13) drives the web view's
units/permits sub-metric picker — project density vs dwelling supply.
`new_dwelling_units` (window total) + `new_dwelling_permits` (count) ride into the
slim file for the tooltip.

**Window toggle (added 2026-07-13).** A second, shorter pinned window
(`PERMIT_YEARS_RECENT` in `main.py` = the last 3 full years, 2023–2025) is
aggregated by a second `load_permits` call and emits `_3yr`-suffixed twins of all
four columns (`new_units_per_acre_3yr`, `new_permits_per_acre_3yr`,
`new_dwelling_units_3yr`, `new_dwelling_permits_3yr`). The base (5yr, 2021–2025)
columns stay **unsuffixed** for backward-compat with the live geojson + web
gates. The web `#devwindow` picker switches 5yr ↔ 3yr; it's gated on the `_3yr`
columns being present (older data files show the 5yr base only). Both windows are
pinned + drift-guarded and bump together each January.

**Long "since 2009" window (added 2026-07-21).** A third window `PERMIT_YEARS_LONG`
(`main.py`) emits `_long`-suffixed twins of all four residential columns (plus
`ind_permits_per_acre_long`) — the cumulative **"density added over the era"** cut
that reproduces the inspiration lens's 2009–2023 "homes added" map. Unlike the two
sliding windows it is **anchored**: the start is fixed at `PERMIT_START_YEAR = 2009`
(the permit record's first year, DATA.md above) and only the end advances, so it is
DERIVED as `range(2009, PERMIT_YEARS[-1] + 1)` — the annual January bump of
`PERMIT_YEARS` extends it automatically, no separate pin to roll. Citywide it sums
~160k units (2009–2025) vs ~60k (5yr) / ~39k (3yr). The web `#devwindow` gains a
**"Since 2009"** button (gated on the `_long` columns) — a **first-class window**:
it drives both the hood choropleth AND its own 100 m detail grid (`export_dev_grid`
emits `units_long`/`permits_long` cells + `coverage["long"]`, added 2026-07-22).
The geocoding lag is on the NEWEST permits, not the oldest — **2009–2023 sit at
95–98% geocoded, 2025 at ~72%** — so the long window is the *best*-covered of the
three grids (84% of units on the grid, vs 79% / 71% for 5yr / 3yr). An earlier cut
made it choropleth-only on the mistaken belief that early-year geocoding was sparse;
the data disproved it (`.venv/bin/python` count by year).

### Key columns (live vocab confirmed 2026-07-12)
| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `units_added` | dwelling-unit numerator. A single apartment permit adds many (GRIESBACH: 2,274 units from 349 permits); a single-detached permit adds 1. Non-numeric → 0 units, kept as a permit, warned. |
| `work_type` | **new-construction filter.** `NEW_WORK_TYPES` = `(01) New` + `(01) Building - New` + `(01) New House`. Suite-adds/conversions (`(07)`/`(08)`/`(09)`) add dwellings but are INFILL densification — excluded from Lens A (they're the Lens B story). ~41k of ~78k in-window rows are null/blank `work_type` — excluded, count reported. **Verified (S48 Fable audit, 2026-07-13): all 40,956 in-window (2021–2025) null-`work_type` rows carry `units_added` = 0 (sum exactly 0), so the exclusion loses ZERO dwelling units** — they are 0-unit sub-permit-like rows (33,669 are `building_type` = Single Detached House), NOT old miscoded new-construction. (The earlier "most predate consistent coding" rationale was wrong.) |
| `building_type` | **residential-dwelling filter.** 71 distinct values with many spelling variants of each category — `Apartments (310)`/`Apartment (310)`/`Apartment Condos (315)`; `Row House (330)`/`Row Houses (330)`; `Semi Detached House` (no code); `Backyard House (110)` (a garden suite, counted). All enumerated in `RESIDENTIAL_BUILDING_TYPES`, never prefix-matched. Garages, commercial, `Mixed Use (522)` excluded. **Also `INDUSTRIAL_BUILDING_TYPES`** (400-series: Animal & Plant Services 410, Manufacturing 430, Maintenance/Hangars 450, Warehouses 460, Communication 470, Utility 480) drives the separate industrial-permit-velocity count (§ below) — enumerated by FULL STRING because codes duplicate across unrelated types (`Parkade (490)` is NOT industrial). ⚠️ **`Engineering (490)` and `Transportation Terminals (440)` were REMOVED 2026-08-18** — measured on `job_description`, 490 is **95% parkades** and 440 is **100% LRT/transit**, and they were putting a $91.2M underground-parkade spike on DOWNTOWN and flagging 7 residential hoods as industrial. They remain in `KNOWN_BUILDING_TYPES` via `NON_INDUSTRIAL_400_SERIES`. ⚠️ **Full-string enumeration did NOT prevent this** — the City files underground parkades under BOTH `Parkade (490)` and `Engineering (490)`, so excluding the obvious string left the same buildings in under the other. |
| `year` | integer permit year — drives the pinned window filter (vs parsing `issue_date`). |
| `neighbourhood` | **UPPERCASE, matches `neighbourhood_name`** — the join key. |
| `construction_value` | **added to the `$select` 2026-08-18** — the industrial detail grid's height (§ below). Documented by the City as *"Estimated value of construction work"*: a **declared estimate at permit application**, not audited spend, never reconciled. The permit fee is derived from it (an incentive to declare low) and **land is excluded**. 78% of values end in `000`, 26% in `00000` — round-number estimating, not accounting. Populated on **99.6%** of industrial new-construction rows (284/285, 5yr). ⚠️ **Nominal** — must be deflated before summing across years (§ below). ⚠️ **13 industrial permits declare exactly $0**, 32 ≤$1,000, 118 ≤$10,000; on a dollar-driven encoding those disappear unless carried by a count. |
| `floor_area` | **square footage** (per the City's field description — this resolves the m² ambiguity: median industrial permit is 3,843 sq ft ≈ 19 m square, comfortably inside a 100 m cell; p95 is 121,214 sq ft, which does span cells). ⚠️ **NOT fetched and NOT usable as an intensity measure** — populated on only **51%** of industrial new-construction permits (vs 99% residential), against `construction_value`'s 99.6%. Considered and rejected 2026-08-18; don't reach for it again without re-measuring coverage. |

### Known Quirks
- **`count(*)` aliases as `count_1`, not `count`** on this dataset (a Socrata
  inconsistency — roads returns `count`). `download_data.server_count` was
  hardened 2026-07-12 to read the sole count column by value, so the truncation
  cross-check works everywhere.
- **"Same data, different cuts":** seven other portal datasets are saved
  filters/map-views over the same two source tables (building permits + dev
  permits) — proven by identical `rowsUpdatedAt`. We pull `24uj-dj8v` and filter
  ourselves; **ignore `itki-s8y9`/`jsf3-5dv2`/`537d-t4az`/`uep4-4w4g`/`ramb-ihnk`**
  (building) and `66ut-y7w2` (dev). See `docs/SPEC_development.md` "Data".
- **Activity ≠ money path** — the name join is **warn-not-fail** (unlike the
  assessment money guard, `scripts/check_unmatched_names.py`): an unmatched
  permit hood is a blank hood, not a silent dollar loss. `CHAPPELLE AREA →
  CHAPPELLE` etc. resolve via the shared `NAME_CORRECTIONS`; the only leftover
  straggler is `GLENORA, ROSSLYN` (1 unit, immaterial).
- `load_permits` HARD-ERRORS if a window year has zero permits (stale
  `PERMIT_YEARS` pin or upstream drift), and keeps-but-warns any `work_type` /
  `building_type` value outside the `KNOWN_*` vocab (it might be a new
  residential variant to count) — same explicit-dictionary discipline as
  `load_fire`. Bump **both** `PERMIT_YEARS` and `PERMIT_YEARS_RECENT` each January.
- **`occupancy_granted_date`** exists in the full schema (a completed-builds
  variant) but is only populated for residential finalized ≥ Jan 1 2022 /
  non-residential ≥ Jan 1 2024 — useless for historical totals, not fetched.
- **Geocoding lags on the newest permits** (`latitude`/`longitude`, probed
  2026-07-14): among in-window new-construction rows, nulls are ~1–2%/yr for
  2021–2023 but 994 permits in 2024 and 3,564 in 2025 — a lag, not a
  structural hole (nearly all null-coord rows still carry `neighbourhood`, so
  hood aggregation is unaffected). The 100 m detail grid
  (`export_dev_grid`) therefore bins **geocoded permits only** — 5yr window at
  build time: 47,125 of 59,697 units (~21% not yet mapped; 3yr ~29%) — and
  writes per-window `coverage` into `dev_grid.json` so the web blurb
  discloses the live percentage. Never backfill with hood centroids. Expect
  coverage to improve as the city geocodes its backlog; the weekly regen
  picks that up automatically.

### Industrial permit velocity (SPEC_industrial.md A3, added 2026-07-18)

The same `24uj-dj8v` permits, cut for industrial construction: `load_permits`
counts new-construction (`NEW_WORK_TYPES`) ∩ `INDUSTRIAL_BUILDING_TYPES`
(400-series, above) permits per hood over the same pinned windows, emitting
**`ind_permits`** (count) → `join_and_calculate` **`ind_permits_per_acre`**
(+ the `_3yr` pair), in `SLIM_COLUMNS`. **Count only** — `units_added` is
meaningless for industrial (no dwellings), and `construction_value` is
reserved (consistent with the Lens C reservation). Aggregated separately from
the residential rollup and outer-merged, so a hood with one kind of activity
but not the other carries a true 0 in the missing column. Real data (2021–2025
window, build time): **283 new industrial permits across 117 hoods** (3yr: 189
across 85); top hoods are the industrial areas (SOUTHEAST INDUSTRIAL, MISTATIM,
CLOVER BAR, WINTERBURN, EASTGATE BUSINESS PARK); per-acre is small (p97.5 ≈
0.015/acre). Web: third `#devmetric` option "Industrial" — a Development-view
choropleth (not an Infill activity — the roll has no industrial-vs-commercial
split anyway, § 2), and **since 2026-08-18 also a 100 m detail grid**
(below). **NOTE — no
industrial-vs-commercial split exists in the assessment roll** (§ 2), so this
permit-based cut is the ONLY industrial-specific spatial signal the project
has; it is construction activity, not assessment base.

#### The industrial 100 m detail grid, and its deflator (added 2026-08-18)

`export_dev_grid` emits `ind_cv` / `ind_n` per window alongside the
residential `units` / `permits`. **Height is deflated construction value, not
permit count** — measured first: **89% of 5yr industrial cells hold exactly
one permit**, so count is a dot map, and **enlarging the cell does not fix it**
(100 m → 400 m is a 16× area increase that removes 19 of 184 cells). Dollars
spread the same cells over 164×.

⚠️ **Nominal dollars encode inflation as development.** Deflated to **constant
2025 dollars** via `data/construction_price_index.json`, built by
`scripts/fetch_construction_price_index.py` from **StatCan table
18-10-0289-01** (GEO `Edmonton, Alberta`, Type of building `Industrial
buildings [62211]`, Division `Division composite`, `Index, 2023=100`, vector
`v1617916332`). Factors: **2009 → 1.717×**, 2021 → 1.325×, 2025 → 1.000×. The
permits' own warehouse $/sqft corroborates independently (1.92× 2009→2025).
A permit year with no deflator **hard-fails**.

⚠️ **A manual, reviewed input** — mill-rates / FIR-debt pattern (§ 4, § 11).
**NOT on the weekly refresh**: a price index that moved silently would restate
every historical spike on the map at once. Re-run by hand when a year
completes, eyeball the diff, commit.

⚠️ **Two predecessor tables are ARCHIVED and must not be pinned**:
18-10-0135 stops at **2022-Q2**, 18-10-0276 at **2024-Q2**. Both still
download and still answer queries — they simply stop — so a stale pin fails
**silently**. The fetcher checks `archiveStatusEn` and warns; the successor is
findable via the WDS `getAllCubesListLite` endpoint.

⚠️ **Zero-dollar permits are carried by `ind_n`, not dropped.** 12 of 1,281
industrial permits declare exactly $0; the client floors their cells to a
visible 6 m. The floor is deliberately small — dwelling units are QUANTISED
(0% of residential cells render under 5 m) while dollars are CONTINUOUS to
zero (39–44% of industrial cells do), and a 60 m floor flattened cells worth
up to $4.6M to the same height as $0.

## 11. Alberta FIR Debt Series (debt lens D5, added 2026-07-14)

**Source:** Alberta Municipal Affairs — Municipal Financial and Statistical
Data (FIR/SIR), `https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/municipal-financial-and-statistical-data`
**Fetch:** `scripts/fetch_fir_debt.py` → committed `data/fir_debt_series.json`
(12 KB). **Manual, reviewed input** (mill-rates pattern): NOT part of the weekly
refresh — re-run when a new financial year publishes (~annually, watch for it
alongside the January year-roll), eyeball the diff, commit. openpyxl/xlrd are
dev-only deps (`requirements.txt`, not `requirements-ci.txt`); the test module
skips itself on CI.
**Format:** one XLSX workbook per financial year, every Alberta municipality.
The debt schedule ("Schedule AA", 8 identical columns 2003–2025) carries FIR
item codes `05700` Debt Limit / `05710` Total Debt / `05720` Debt Service
Limit / `05730` Total Debt Service Costs.
**Extracted:** EDMONTON (code `0098`), ST. ALBERT (`0292`), STRATHCONA COUNTY
(`0302`) — the two peers the debt-lens brief benchmarks against — for
2003–2025 (23 years; one year further than the brief expected).
**Licence:** Open Government Licence – Alberta

**Why:** debt-lens ticket D5 (`docs/fable_brief_debt_lens.md` Component 2) —
the citywide debt context annotation (trend + peer benchmark, explicitly
non-spatial). The display/chart is a separate, undecided design step; this is
the data layer only.

### Format eras (all verified 2026-07-14)
| Years | Where | Debt sheet |
|---|---|---|
| 2017–2025 | standalone `YYYY_financial_year.xlsx` on the dataset page | `AA(1)-Debt` |
| 2009–2016 | inside `2009-2016-municipal_financial-data-and-statistics.zip` | `AA(1)-Debt` |
| 2004–2008 | inside `xlsx-2003-2008.zip`, per-schedule `YYYY/YYYY-AA-Debt Info.xlsx` | `Schedule AA` |
| 2003 | same zip, legacy `2003-EA-MR/GR Debt Info.xls` (xlrd) | `GR Debt Info` |

(A `xlsx-2002-1994.zip` also exists if the series is ever extended back.)

### Known Quirks
- **STRATHCONA COUNTY 2013 is reported in $000s** in the source workbook (debt
  limit `485,926` between real-dollar neighbours 473.9M/504.2M). The fetch
  script applies a documented ×1000 correction (`KNOWN_UNIT_CORRECTIONS`),
  records `unit_corrected: 1000` on that year's JSON record, and a
  neighbour-band sanity check (factor 5 vs adjacent years) hard-fails if a new
  unit slip ever appears.
- **The FIR "Debt Limit" is the MGA regulation limit** (Debt Limit Regulation
  255/2000 — 2× revenue for most municipalities; Edmonton/Calgary have their
  own), **NOT Edmonton's internal DMFP policy limits** (≤18% tax-supported /
  ≤21% total debt servicing) that the "69% of limit" headline in the debt-lens
  brief refers to. Don't conflate the two in any display. On FIR terms,
  Edmonton 2025 total debt = 59.3% of its MGA debt limit.
- **Anchor cross-checks** pin the extraction to independently published
  figures: Edmonton 2025 total debt $4,592,150,000 (the brief's "$4.6B"
  reported to Council 2026-03-17) and Strathcona County 2022 $133,070,148 (the
  brief's audited peer datapoint). A mismatch on re-fetch means the province
  restated data → human review (`--allow-anchor-drift` to accept).
- Edmonton's series is NOT monotonic — e.g. 2017 drops to $2.91B from $3.34B
  (2016) before climbing again; real amortization, not a data error (both
  years pass the neighbour band).

## 12. Off-Site Levy Fire-Hall Catchments (debt lens D0, added 2026-07-15)
Source: **Off-Site Levy Bylaw 19340**, `edmonton.ca/business_economy/off-site-levy-bylaw`
(laptop-reachable only). The 12 fire-hall levy catchments are the Component 1
spatial join key in the debt-lens brief.
- Raw artifacts in `data/raw/offsite_levy/`: `BL19340_offsite_levy_bylaw.pdf`,
  `ScheduleA_catchment_map.jpg` (the catchment map exhibit, bylaw p.7),
  `2026_approved_rates.pdf` (cost/area/rate table).
- **No GIS vector layer exists** — data.edmonton.ca (0 Socrata hits), ArcGIS Hub
  (Calgary layers only), and the bylaw page all lack one. Boundaries are
  published **only as the Schedule A raster**. Full investigation +
  neighbourhood-union feasibility (which catchments the 407-hood grid can/can't
  reproduce, with per-catchment area validation) in
  `docs/FINDINGS_offsite_levy_catchments.md`.
- **Derived product: `data/levy_catchments.geojson`** (10 features, committed) —
  each catchment approximated as a union of neighbourhoods via
  `scripts/build_levy_catchments.py` (manual reviewed input, like
  `fetch_fir_debt.py`; NOT in the weekly refresh). The editable `CATCHMENT_HOODS`
  table maps hoods to catchments read off Schedule A. The 12 bylaw catchments
  collapse to **10 units**: EETP + Northeast EETP and Horse Hill + Northeast
  Horse Hill are each merged (the far-greenfield grid is one giant hood per
  corner). Each feature carries the brief's levy attributes + a `union_ha` /
  `area_ratio` QA field + an `approximation` label. Tests:
  `tests/test_build_levy_catchments.py`.
### Known Quirks
- **Boundaries are advisory** — the bylaw states the City "may adjust and refine"
  catchment boundaries over time; the map footnote says "subject to change." Any
  derived polygon layer must be labelled "approximated to neighbourhood
  boundaries," not presented as authoritative.
- **`EDMONTON ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY PARK` (one 5,334 ha hood) spans BOTH the EETP
  and Northeast EETP catchments** — the neighbourhood grid is too coarse in the
  far greenfield to separate them by union (see FINDINGS §3).

## 13. City Service Unit Costs (V2 cost-per-acre, added 2026-07-15)
`data/city_unit_costs.json` — MODELED unit costs for the V2 "city service cost
per acre" composite (`SPEC_utilities` decision 3). Manual reviewed input
(mill-rates pattern; NOT auto-fetched, NOT in the weekly refresh). Sourced on
Peter's laptop (edmonton.ca unreachable from the Oracle box). **Roads + fire
only** — never label the derived metric "total city cost".
- **Roadway = $50/m/yr** (O&M + renewal). Source: edmonton.ca "Development Impact
  on Infrastructure" — neighbourhood road $600k O&M + $1.9M renewal per km,
  annualized over a 50-yr life (Peter's call 2026-07-15); 3%-of-value rule
  cross-checks (~$45). Applies to the collector+local `road_m_per_acre` metres.
- **Fire = 2026 gross operating budget $276.706M** (net $273.598M, 1,361 FTE).
  Source: City of Edmonton 2026 Approved Operating Budget PDF, Fire Rescue
  Services line. The V2 fire term divides this by the pipeline's OWN citywide
  kept-event total (don't hardcode dispatches), so the unit cost's denominator
  matches the `fire_events_per_acre` numerator.
- **Consumed (2026-07-15)** by `join_and_calculate.load_unit_costs` (validates
  loudly — a malformed hand edit fails the pipeline) → the `unit_costs` arg
  computes `svc_cost_per_acre` (in `SLIM_COLUMNS`). The per-event divisor is
  the fire frame's citywide sum PRE-join (unmatched fire hoods stay in the
  denominator). Composite requires BOTH the roads and fire lenses; either
  missing → warn + skip. `main.py --skip-service-cost` / `--unit-costs-json`.
- **Displayed (2026-07-16)** two ways (`web/index.html`): the Services view's
  "Service cost (roads+fire)" checkbox (SERVICES `servicecost`, sqrt colour on
  the shared `svc-plane`) AND the Ratio view's "Per service $" denominator
  (`revenue_per_acre / svc_cost_per_acre` — dimensionless coverage, log colour,
  RATIO_DENOMS `servicecost`). Both carry the caveats below; the ratio copy also
  states it reads ≫1 because the cost side is only two services (median ≈5.8×),
  NOT "pays its way". The column ships to the live GeoJSON on the first refresh
  after the metric PR #59 — until then both controls are column-guarded off.
### The OPERATING trio (added 2026-08-03, transportation lens Stage 2)
The same file also carries `roadway_ops`, `bikeway_ops`, `parking_ops`, and
`transit_ets`, on a **strictly operating basis** — maintenance, snow clearing,
or program operating budget, **no capital**.
- **Roadway ops = $4.635/m/yr** ($1,285/km maintain + $3,350/km snow).
- **Bikeway ops = $20.278/m/yr** ($178/km maintain + $20,100/km snow) — a
  bikeway metre costs **4.4× a road metre** to operate: cheap to keep up,
  expensive to clear (24-hour bare-pavement standard).
- **Parking Operations = $7.067M gross operating expenses (2025 Tax Supported)**
  from Edmonton Open Budget `operating_budget.csv`, filtered to program
  `OPS/PARS - Parking Operations`, account type `Expenses`, positive budget
  rows only. Allocated by each neighbourhood's share of deduplicated
  City-managed parkade/surface-lot stalls from `tsq5-xp73`.
- **Transit = ETS bus+LRT gross $436.605M (2025)**; **DATS excluded** ($31.966M
  of the $468.571M total) because it is door-to-door and generates no scheduled
  stop-events. Divided by the pipeline's OWN citywide stop-event total, like fire.
- Source for the two road/bike rates: Taproot Edmonton reporting quoting City
  infrastructure field operations staff; parking from Edmonton Open Budget; ETS
  from the 2024/2025 Annual Service Plan Appendix A. The road/bike rates were
  **relayed**, not fetched from the Oracle box.
### Known Quirks
- **The fire term is a demand ALLOCATION of a mostly-fixed budget** — a hood with
  2× the events does not cost the City 2× (most fire cost is standing capacity).
  Carry that caveat in any UI copy. **The transit term has the identical shape.**
  **Parking is also an allocation**, by stall share, not audited facility-level
  operating spend; the Parking Operations program is broader than the off-street
  parkade/surface-lot inventory and likely includes curbside/EPark operations.
- ⚠️ **THIS FILE HOLDS TWO INCOMPATIBLE BASES.** `roadway_om_renewal` is
  **$50/m/yr lifecycle**; `roadway_ops` is **$4.635/m/yr operating** — the SAME
  metres, **~10.8× apart**, and both ship to the served GeoJSON. Never sum or
  compare them. The `_ops` column suffix exists solely to keep them apart; a
  test pins them distinct. See the file's own `_two_bases` field.
- **`roadway_renewal` = $38/m/yr is the RENEWAL HALF of basis (1), not a third
  basis** (added 2026-08-07). The $50 decomposes into its two published
  components over the same 50-yr life: **$12/m/yr O&M + $38/m/yr renewal**.
  ⚠️ **Never sum `roadway_renewal` with `roadway_om_renewal`** — that
  double-counts renewal; exactly one of the two may appear in any figure.
  ⚠️ **The $12 O&M half is deliberately NOT published**: it would sit beside
  `roadway_ops`' $4.635/m/yr as a *second* recurring road number, ~2.6× apart
  from it and from a different source. Renewal was chosen precisely because it
  does not collide. **Inert to the served pipeline** — `load_unit_costs` reads operating blocks
  and selected lifecycle road/service inputs, but not `roadway_renewal`; only
  `tools/ward_rollup.py` reads it. ⚠️ Anything built on it is an annual
  **REQUIREMENT, not a funding gap**, and **collector+local only** (arterials
  excluded), so it understates the network. `DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-07.
- ⚠️ **$178/km/yr IS NOT A LIFECYCLE RATE**, though it was proposed as one on the
  phrasing "replace, repair, and maintain". It derives from ~$0.27M/yr over
  ~1,500 km; the same source puts snow clearing on that network at **113× it**;
  at a 50-yr life it totals **$8,900/km** for build plus all replacement; and
  against the City's own ~3%/yr set-aside rule it is **~33× low**. Full record in
  `bikeway_ops.rejected_lifecycle_reading`. **No bikeway lifecycle figure exists
  yet** — that is an open TODO item, now blocked on ONE missing input (below).
- **Bikeway CAPITAL = $452,065/km, sourced and verified 2026-08-04** on Peter's
  laptop → `bikeway_capital`. Source: **Bike Plan Implementation Guide §1.2,
  Table 3** (678 km / $306.5M; bands $365k–$790k/km by urban form),
  construction-only and explicitly excluding maintenance. Checked, not relayed:
  every row's implied $/km lands inside its own stated band and the $190.8M
  City-borne subtotal reconciles. ⚠️ **This is $/km of ASSET VALUE, not a rate —
  it is INERT**, read by nothing (`load_unit_costs` reads the operating blocks
  and lifecycle road/service inputs, not this capital-only block).
- ⚠️ **THE ONLY THING STILL MISSING IS A SERVICE LIFE, AND EDMONTON DOES NOT
  PUBLISH ONE** for bikeways or shared pathways. Searched 2026-08-04: the
  Development Impact page (roads + fire stations only), both Bike Plan PDFs, the
  2025 Infrastructure Report, the Infrastructure State-and-Condition / Inventory
  / Tools pages, the 2023 Capital Asset Management Audit. The Bike Plan's own
  action **9.6.2(a) is to *"establish"* a bikeway asset-management program** —
  the City flagged it as not yet existing. ⚠️ **Do NOT press the sidewalk
  figure into service:** *"amortized for 20 years"* on the sidewalk-
  reconstruction page is a **local-improvement tax levy term, not an asset
  life** — the same category error as the $178/km reading.
- ⚠️ **THE 3% SET-ASIDE RULE DOES NOT TRANSFER TO BIKEWAYS** — it is tempting as
  a way around the missing life, and this project's own numbers falsify it. At
  roads' implied 3.33%/yr, $452,065/km allows **$15,069/km/yr** for all O&M plus
  renewal, but measured `bikeway_ops` is **$20,278/km/yr — 1.35× that entire
  allowance** before any capital renewal. Bikeway cost tracks a winter **service
  standard**, not asset value. (The rule is asset-specific in the source anyway:
  fire stations get *"at least 6%"*.)
- ⚠️ **A THIRD numerator/denominator mismatch, direction KNOWABLE this time.**
  Table 3 blends the **future** facility mix; `bike_m_per_acre` measures the
  **existing** stock, which is **82.2% Shared Pathway and 89.8% off-road**, with
  only **0.8% Local Street Bikeway** — the cheap on-street types the blend leans
  on. So $452,065/km most likely **understates** our network's replacement
  value. Cross-check, not a competing value: the $100M Active Transportation
  Network Expansion over 68 km is **~$1.47M/km**, but that is a whole-program
  budget (design, contingency, land) in the dearer inside-Henday contexts.
- ⚠️ **Two rate/denominator mismatches, recorded not absorbed.** The bike snow
  rate blends over a ~1,500 km network the source defines as *"bike lanes,
  multi-use paths, public pedestrian squares, bus stops, LRT platforms, and
  staircases"* — substantially **not** dedicated bikeway, while our numerator
  (~981 km) is. The road snow rate blends over ~11,000 km **including arterials**,
  which are priority-cleared and cost more per km, so the local-road term is
  likely a little high. **The 11,000 km denominator is never imported into the
  spatial pipeline** — only the per-km rate is.
- ⚠️ **Vintage mismatch, accepted:** ETS is 2025 while fire is 2026 Approved.
  They never enter the same composite (fire → `svc_cost_per_acre`, transit →
  `transport_cost_ops_per_acre`), so it is across columns, not inside a number.
- **Sidewalks are a separate, non-overlapping category** (~5,776 km, ~$5.9M/yr
  ops) and are in neither the bike metric nor the 1,500 km snow denominator.
- ⚠️ **Do not sum Transportation Operating cost with lifecycle road/service cost.**
  `roadway_ops`, `bikeway_ops`, and `parking_ops` are annual operating-only
  terms. They sit beside, not inside, `roadway_om_renewal`'s lifecycle road
  reconstruction basis.

## 14. Geographic Reference Layers (orientation, added 2026-07-27)
`web/data/reference.geojson` (**94 kB, 33 features**, committed) — the North
Saskatchewan River, the regional **highway network**, and the named regional
geography. So a first-time viewer can orient before reading the fiscal data. The
map has **no basemap tiles** (just a dark backdrop), so without these there is
no geographic context at all. Purely cartographic: no metric, no tooltip.

**Every feature carries `kind`, and boundaries carry `name` (2026-08-08).**
Before that all 13 outlines shipped as a bare `{"t":"boundary"}` and the front
end **could not tell Edmonton's own legal limit from Devon's town outline** —
they drew in one colour because nothing distinguished them. The tiers:

| `kind` | what | drawn | named |
|---|---|---|---|
| `city` | Edmonton's legal limit | lighter, wider stroke | **no** — the page title already says Edmonton, and a label at the centre sits on the choropleth |
| `region` | the four counties it abuts | faint outline | yes (**reversal** — see below) |
| `place` | 9 neighbouring municipalities | faint outline | yes |
| `zone` | Alberta's Industrial Heartland | dim warm outline | yes |
| `econ` | Nisku, Edmonton Int'l Airport | **none** | yes |

⚠️ **Regions were deliberately UNLABELLED until 2026-08-08 and that reversed**
(Peter). The original reasoning — a county is too large to label at city zoom,
and the edge, not the name, is the message — holds for an *orientation* map and
fails for a *regional* one: once the question is "who else levies here, and what
does Edmonton not tax", an unnamed edge cannot answer it. ⚠️ The old objection
survives in the ANCHOR: a county centroid sits **27–58 km** from Edmonton's
centre, so centroid labels land off the default camera entirely. Labels are
placed on the county's visible strip near the city (`_region_anchor`).

⚠️ **`econ` names have no outline on purpose.** Nisku is a *hamlet* — Alberta
publishes hamlets as points only, so no legal polygon exists to draw. The
airport has an OSM polygon, but it is a ~28 km² shape 40 km south rendered at
1 px: naming it locates it, tracing it does not, and a municipal-grey outline
would read as another jurisdiction.

⚠️ **The Industrial Heartland's identification is OURS, not the source's.**
Alberta publishes it as one unnamed 590.7 km² MultiPolygon in
`boundaries/resource_designated_industrial_zone` — **no name field at all**. It
was identified by measuring who it overlaps: Sturgeon County 171.8, Strathcona
County 134.3, **Edmonton 53.2**, Fort Saskatchewan 29.5 km², remainder ≈ Lamont
County. That is exactly the Heartland's member set, and 590.7 km² matches the
~582 km² the association publishes. The builder guards it with an area floor
(`ZONE_MIN_KM2`) because there is no name to assert against.
⚠️ **53.2 km² of it is inside Edmonton's own boundary**, so unlike the airport
and Nisku it is *not* a clean "regional infrastructure Edmonton doesn't tax"
shape. Do not narrate it as one.

⚠️ **RETRACTED 2026-08-09 — "14% of Edmonton is missing from the hood fabric"
WAS WRONG, and the error was one of CAUSE, not arithmetic.** The 2026-08-08 note
read the drawn map's **672.4 km²** against a **782.1 km²** city and concluded
that **109.6 km² (14.0%) was annexed and undeveloped land carrying no
neighbourhood**. Re-measured in `EPSG:3400` from `data/raw/neighbourhoods.geojson`:

| what | km² |
|---|---|
| raw boundary file, all 407 features | **782.11** |
| the 406 hoods that render, raw geometry | **782.00** |
| legal boundary polygon (`reference.geojson`, simplified 100 m) | **782.38** |
| shipped `neighbourhood_value_per_acre.geojson` | **672.42** |

**The raw fabric tiles the city** — 1.4 km² of legal boundary is uncovered and
1.1 km² of fabric sits outside it, both inside the 100 m simplification noise on
that outline. **The 109.6 km² is `main.py`'s `SETBACK_M = 45.0`**, the inward
buffer that opens "city block" gaps between prisms: **every one of the 406 hoods
loses area** (median **18.3%**, min 2.7%, max 65.9% — the signature of a
perimeter-proportional shrink, not of missing land), and `buffer(-45)` then
`simplify(10)` reproduces **672.42 km²** to the decimal. The only hood in the
file that truly carries no data is `LEWIS FARMS`, **0.11 km²**.
- **No metric is affected** — and this is now true for a stronger reason than
  the original note gave. Metrics are per-neighbourhood over *upstream* areas;
  `setback_m` and `simplify_tolerance_m` are documented DISPLAY-only in
  `join_and_calculate.py`. ⚠️ **For a citywide-per-acre figure there are TWO
  denominators, not three: ~782 km² total and ~771 km² land.** `672.4` is not a
  candidate at all — it is drawn geometry and has no analytical meaning. The
  retracted note listed it as one, which is the trap this entry now exists to
  close.
- ⚠️ **782.1 km² INCLUDES WATER, and that is why it will not match a published
  figure** (measured 2026-08-08). Commonly cited areas for Edmonton are ~765–768
  km², which are **land** areas. Subtracting the North Saskatchewan where it
  runs inside the city (**10.9 km²**, from this layer's own river geometry)
  gives **~771 km²**, and other water bodies close most of the remaining ~3 km².
  **So there are two denominators** — legal total ~782, legal land ~771 — and a
  citywide figure must say which. A reader checking our number against Wikipedia
  or StatCan will hit this first. (The retracted note above made this a list of
  *three* by counting the drawn 672.4; it is not a denominator.)

Built by `scripts/build_reference_layers.py`. **NOT in the weekly refresh** —
static geography, same posture as `build_levy_catchments.py`; the endpoints are
queried once at build time, never at runtime. Features carry `t`
(`"river"` | `"highway"` | `"boundary"` | `"place"`), matching
`roads.geojson`'s convention; `place` features additionally carry `name`.

⚠️ **REVISED 2026-08-03 — `t="henday"` IS GONE, replaced by `t="highway"`.**
The old layer was the Anthony Henday alone, hand-extracted from the City
centreline feed, and it **stopped at the city limit**. Peter's ask was for the
main highways to run off the edge of the frame the way the river does. See
"Why OSM" below; the retired extraction's quirks are in `TODO_archive.md`.

- **River** — Alberta `base_water_feature` MapServer **layer 72**
  (`Lake/River (20K)`), `NAME='North Saskatchewan River'` (7 polygons
  province-wide, all genuinely the river). Clipped to the city bbox + a **60 km**
  margin so it runs clean off the edge of the view rather than stopping dead —
  the city sits *on* a river that comes from and goes somewhere, and two square
  ends just inside the frame read as a lake. The margin is sized against the
  default camera: at HOME zoom 10.2 and latitude 53.5 the scale is ~79 m/px, so
  a 1440px viewport spans ~114 km flat and the 52° pitch pushes the horizon
  further; the city half-width is only ~15 km. Natively **EPSG:3400**.
  **95% of the file** and deliberately never re-simplified (settled 2026-07-27:
  Peter checked the sub-pixel islands on device — they do not read as speckle).
- **Highways** — **OpenStreetMap via Overpass** (`overpass-api.de`), classes
  **`motorway` + `trunk`**, clipped to the *same* 60 km box as the river.
  Measured 2026-08-03: 1,194 ways / 999 km raw → **871 km welded in 89 parts**,
  of which **68% lies outside the city** and the extent exceeds the city bbox on
  all four sides. Top routes: Hwy 16 (Yellowhead) 337 km, Hwy 2 (QEII) 213 km,
  Hwy 216 (Henday) 156 km, Hwy 43 131 km, then 63/28/15/16A.
- **Boundaries + places** — Alberta `urban_and_rural_municipality` MapServer.
  Seven names (`PLACES` in the build script): St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Spruce
  Grove, Fort Saskatchewan, Leduc, Beaumont, Devon. Each yields **one Polygon**
  (the largest, simplified at 100 m — 169 vertices for all seven, ~3.6 kB) and
  **one Point** at that same polygon's centroid, so a label and the shape it
  names cannot disagree. Natively **EPSG:3400**.

### Why OSM, and the trap in the obvious alternative
Two sources were tried and rejected on 2026-08-03:
- **The City centreline feed** (`data/raw/roads.geojson`) carries every main
  highway — Yellowhead, Calgary Trail, Manning, Sherwood Park Fwy, Hwy 14/15/216
  — as `Province of Alberta` rows that `load_roads` filters out. But it is a
  *City* feed: the highways **stop at the municipal boundary**, which is exactly
  the amputated look `MARGIN_M` exists to prevent for the river.
- ⚠️ **Alberta's `transportation/highways_public` MapServer RETURNS NULL
  GEOMETRY.** It has ideal attributes (510 `IN SERVICE` segments with
  `ROAD_NUMBER` over this extent) and answers **HTTP 200 with all 510 features
  and no shapes** — in `f=geojson` and `f=json`, with and without `outSR`, with
  and without an envelope, on the simplest possible `where`. Its
  `capabilities` still advertise `Query`. **A reader that trusts the feature
  count would emit an empty highway layer and log success.**

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **Overpass answers `406 Not Acceptable` to a raw POST body or an anonymous
  client.** The query must be **form-encoded as `data=`** with a **named
  `User-Agent`** (`OVERPASS_USER_AGENT`), as its usage policy asks.
- **OSM is ODbL**, so the credit is required *wherever the data is used*. The
  Data & Methods pod carries it in **both** builds — unlike the City
  road/fire/transit credits, which are full-only because those lenses are.
- **`primary` is deliberately NOT in `HIGHWAY_CLASSES`** — it would add ~1,591
  ways and ~1,786 km of in-city arterials, tripling the file and competing with
  the choropleth on a map that has no basemap precisely so the data reads first.
- **The highway layer is many OPEN-ENDED corridors** (89 parts), by design: they
  run off the clip edge. Anything asserting closure — as the retired Henday ring
  check did — is asserting the wrong invariant. The live assertion is that the
  network **extends past the city on all four sides**
  (`verify-reference-layer.js`), falsified by clipping it to the city limit.
- **Hwy 216 measures 156 km in OSM vs the 149 km** the retired City-feed
  extraction produced for the ring's two carriageways. Agreement within ~5% is
  what justified dropping the hand-tuned extractor; `HIGHWAY_RING_REF_KM` warns
  if that drifts past 25%.
- **At the 60 km clip the river is a MultiPolygon** (disjoint stretches up- and
  downstream), where a narrow clip yields a single Polygon. Anything asserting
  its geometry type must accept both.
- ⚠️ **`REGIONS` outlines are deliberately NOT clipped to the view extent**,
  unlike the river and the highways. Those are open shapes that would stop dead
  mid-frame without a clip; a municipality is a **closed ring**, so clipping one
  replaces its far side with a straight run along the clip box that **draws as
  if it were a real border**. Parkland County is the only one that leaves the
  extent (66.7% inside) and it simply runs off the edge.
- ⚠️ **Strathcona County is in sublayer 104 (`Specialized Municipality`,
  `SPMUN_NAME`), NOT 114** (`Municipal District and County`) with the other
  three. Alberta models specialized municipalities separately, so looking in the
  obvious county layer returns nothing. This is the `REGIONS` equivalent of the
  Sherwood Park / layer-66 trap above.
- ⚠️ **"Leduc" names two different polygons across the two lists** — the CITY of
  Leduc (`PLACES`, layer 78) sits INSIDE **Leduc County** (`REGIONS`, layer
  114). Querying one where the other is meant returns a shape of the wrong
  scale with no error.
- **`boundary` features are no longer 1:1 with `place` features** (12 vs 7).
  That used to be an asserted invariant in `verify-reference-layer.js`; it was
  retired deliberately, not broken — `REGIONS` outlines carry no name because
  these shapes are far too large to label at city zoom (Parkland County alone
  is 3.5× Edmonton).
- **Municipal outlines are drawn UNDER the data**, with the river. The seven
  places sit outside Edmonton, so no hood polygon hides them (measured: 0–0.7%
  of each outline overlaps the city fabric) — and underneath they can never cut
  across a prism the way an over-composed line would.
- **The municipality service models legal STATUS, not size, so the seven places
  need THREE sublayers** — and the obvious single-layer implementation silently
  finds nothing for two of them:
  | Sublayer | Name | Field | Places |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **78** | City | `CITY_NAME` | St. Albert, Spruce Grove, Fort Saskatchewan, Leduc, Beaumont |
  | **56** | Town | `TOWN_NAME` | Devon |
  | **66** | Urban Service Area | `USA_NAME` | Sherwood Park |
  **Sherwood Park is the trap:** it is not a town or a city but an urban
  service area of Strathcona County, so it is in neither 78 nor 56. (Distinct
  again from **104**, `Specialized Municipality`, which holds *Strathcona
  County itself* — see the Tier 3 boundary note.) **Beaumont has been a city
  since 2019**, so it is in 78 rather than 56.
- **Sublayer 66 also holds `Sherwood Park (Bremner)`**, a separate
  future-growth polygon ~10 km east. The query matches on **equality**, not a
  prefix or `LIKE` — a pattern match would pull Bremner in and drag the label
  anchor off the real town.
- **`PLACES` is a closed hand-written list, not a radius query.** Which names
  belong on the map is a cartographic judgement (how populated should the frame
  feel?), so it is stated rather than derived: a bbox sweep would silently gain
  and lose names as the province edits boundaries, and the map's composition
  would drift with it. A name that stops resolving **raises** rather than
  quietly shipping a map with a hole in its orientation.
- **Leduc is off the bottom edge at the default camera** (projects to y≈1102 in
  a 900px viewport at HOME zoom + 52° pitch) and is culled by the label
  declutterer. That is correct behaviour, not a missing label — it appears on
  pan or zoom-out. Anything asserting "all seven visible" will fail.

## Name Matching

Neighbourhood names between the two sources may not align exactly. Normalization (strip + uppercase) and the `NAME_CORRECTIONS` dict (keyed assessment name → boundary name) are applied in `load_assessment.py`, *before* aggregation — applying corrections after aggregation could collapse two summed rows onto one boundary and duplicate it. `join_and_calculate.py` then does a normalized exact match on the already-corrected names and flags whatever remains unmatched.

**Investigation script:** `scripts/investigate_neighbourhood_names.py`

### Confirmed correction dict (assessment name → boundary name)

```python
NAME_CORRECTIONS = {
    "ANTHONY HENDAY SOUTHEAST":        "ANTHONY HENDAY SOUTH EAST",
    "CHAPPELLE AREA":                   "CHAPPELLE",
    "EDMONTON RESEARCH AND DEVEL PARK": "EDMONTON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PARK",
    "HERITAGE VALLEY TOWN CENTRE AREA": "HERITAGE VALLEY TOWN CENTRE",
    "LEWIS FARMS INDUSTRIAL":           "LEWIS FARMS BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT",
    "PLACE LA RUE":                     "PLACE LARUE",
    "RAPPERSWIL":                       "RAPPERSWILL",
    "RIVER VALLEY WINDEMERE":           "RIVER VALLEY WINDERMERE",
    "SOUTHEAST (ANNEXED) INDUSTRIAL":   "SOUTHEAST INDUSTRIAL",
    "WESTBROOK ESTATE":                 "WESTBROOK ESTATES",
}
```

### Resolved

| Assessment name | Boundary name | Resolution |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| `OLIVER` | `WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN` (#1151) | 2024 rename. Assessment data has already migrated: 12,234 rows / $4.12B are tagged `WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN` (matches the boundary directly), with a single straggler row still tagged `OLIVER` ($500 total). The unmatched warning is real but immaterial — no correction-dict entry added, since mapping it would shift $500 onto a $4.12B neighbourhood. |
| `HERITAGE VALLEY TOWN CENTRE AREA` | `HERITAGE VALLEY TOWN CENTRE` | Resolved 2026-07-01 (data-integrity audit): spatial containment — 945 of 946 properties fall inside the HVTC boundary polygon (1 in adjacent Desrochers). Before the correction the boundary matched only a 15-row / $2.25M slice under the exact name, rendering the hood at ~1/250th of its real $572.7M — a *partial* match, so the error was invisible on the map. Correction added. See `docs/FINDINGS_data_integrity_audit.md` §1. |
| `LEWIS FARMS INDUSTRIAL` | `LEWIS FARMS BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT` | Resolved 2026-07-01 (data-integrity audit): spatial containment — 100 of 103 properties ($106.3M) fall inside the LFBE polygon (3 spill into adjacent LEWIS FARMS, boundary-edge cases). Previously LFBE had zero matched rows → dropped at export → hole in the map. Correction added. See `docs/FINDINGS_data_integrity_audit.md` §2. |

### Unresolved

*None.* The only expected unmatched warning is the `OLIVER` straggler (immaterial, deliberate — see Resolved above). Any **other** name appearing in the unmatched warning is new drift and should be investigated (spatial containment via the assessment lat/lon columns is the decisive test). **This is now enforced in CI:** `scripts/check_unmatched_names.py` asserts the live money-path unmatched set equals the committed baseline `data/expected_unmatched.json` (`{OLIVER}` assessment-side, `{LEWIS FARMS}` boundary-side) and fails the weekly build on a new assessment-side name — see RUNBOOK §2 "Check unmatched names".

## Per-property zoning: use the POLYGONS, not `dkk9-cj3x`'s `zoning` field (2026-08-01)

Measured while building the revenue-lens readout (`src/revenue_by_zone.py`).

`dkk9-cj3x` ("Property Info") carries a `zoning` string per account, and joining
it to the assessment roll on `account_number` is clean — 1:1, no duplicates, every
tax class matched. **It is still the wrong source here.**

| | |
|---|---|
| properties with **null** `zoning` | **35.7%** (157,030 / 439,685) |
| **revenue** with null `zoning` | **16.0%** ($433M of $2.70B) |
| **DOWNTOWN**'s revenue with null `zoning` | **42%** |

The nulls are **condo units** — Downtown is 95% unzoned by property count. A
"top 3 zones by revenue" built on this field showed *unzoned* as Downtown's
largest single entry.

**The fix, and why it is better than a workaround:** every one of those
properties has coordinates (`latitude`/`longitude`, 100% non-null in the cleaned
assessment frame), and a point-in-polygon against `data/raw/zoning.geojson`
placed **11,022 / 11,022** of Downtown's unzoned properties. Citywide the
unplaced share falls from 16.0% to **0.002%** (8 properties, $9,034). Because
those are the *same* polygons the Uses lens colours by area, revenue-by-zone and
the Uses composition become one map read two ways and cannot disagree.

**Two traps found doing this, both silent:**
- `.str.split().str[0]` on an empty string yields **NaN, not `""`** — a
  "code is present but unmatched" filter written the obvious way silently
  swallows every null-zoning row, and reported 16.04% of revenue as sitting in
  three rare zone codes. It is 0.003%.
- `gpd.sjoin` where **both** frames carry a `zoning` column suffixes them to
  `zoning_left`/`zoning_right`, and the later lookup fails or silently reads the
  wrong side. Drop the left one first.

**Coverage of the category map:** 75 of the 78 codes present resolve through
`load_zoning.ZONE_CATEGORY`; the three that do not (`CSC`, `RSL`, `US`) carry
**0.003%** of revenue and fall to `other`, flagged.

⚠️ **1,585 properties sit exactly on a zone boundary** and match two polygons.
`sjoin` emits a row per match, so they must be de-duplicated or their levy is
double-counted and the per-hood fractions stop summing to 1.

## 15. Bike Routes (transportation lens, added 2026-08-02)
`vd4b-a4iv` ("Bike Routes") — on- and off-road cycling routes as
MultiLineStrings, EPSG:4326 via Socrata GeoJSON. **10,417 segments** on first
pull (2026-08-02); 8.0 MB raw. Feed is live and City-maintained (`updatedAt`
2026-07-27). Downloaded by `scripts/download_data.py` (`bike_routes`), both
truncation guards active (`$limit=20000`, server `count(*)` cross-check).
**Consumed by `src/load_bike.py`** → `bike_m_per_acre` (SPEC_services.md
"Transportation lens"). Carries no roll-year pin — like roads and transit its
provenance is `last_checked`.

### Key columns
- `classification` — the 12-value closed enumeration that decides what counts;
  see the table below. Mapped by an EXPLICIT dict (`CLASSIFICATION_GROUP`).
- `route_coming_soon` — real bool. **651 rows are `True`**: planned, not built.
- `type` — `ON ROAD` / `OFF ROAD`. Orthogonal to `classification` (Shared
  Pathway appears as both), so it is kept only as the internal
  `bike_m_onroad` / `bike_m_offroad` split, never as the classifier.
- `network_classification`, `road_segment_type`, `construction_year`,
  `street_name_full`, `duration`, `line_weight` — unused.

### What counts, and the two traps
Measured 2026-08-02, kilometres of built (not coming-soon) route:

| classification | km | group |
|---|---|---|
| Shared Pathway | 806.4 | **dedicated** |
| Shared Trail | 74.7 | **dedicated** |
| Protected Bike Lane | 56.7 | **dedicated** |
| Painted Bike Lane | 27.9 | **dedicated** |
| Local Street Bikeway | 7.9 | **dedicated** |
| Contra-Flow Bike Lane | 7.4 | **dedicated** |
| Shared Roadway - Lower Traffic | 194.7 | shared_roadway (excluded) |
| Shared Roadway - Higher Traffic | 76.4 | shared_roadway (excluded) |
| Bus / Bike / Taxi Lane | 9.0 | shared_roadway (excluded) |
| Walkway / Breezeway | 238.7 | pedestrian (excluded) |
| Maintenance Access | 1.9 | pedestrian (excluded) |
| Unclassified | — | unclassified (excluded; 100% coming-soon) |

⚠️ **TRAP 1 — "Shared Roadway" IS A ROAD, AND IT IS ALREADY COUNTED.** Those
280 km are ordinary streets carrying a bike-route designation. They add no
asset, and `load_roads` already counts their metres in `road_m_total`, so
including them double-counts the road network against itself. This is why the
two supply columns are safe to read side by side.

⚠️ **TRAP 2 — "Walkway / Breezeway" IS 3,031 ROWS OF PEDESTRIAN PATH**, the
second-largest classification in the whole feed. A naive "sum the bike routes"
metric is ~50% not-bike by length.

### Known Quirks
- **Unmatched classifications default to EXCLUDED**, the opposite of
  `load_roads`' default-to-local. The feed is mostly *not* bike infrastructure,
  so an unrecognised value is more likely another non-asset; defaulting in would
  let upstream drift silently inflate a supply metric. Warned loudly either way.
- **981 km kept, 1.17% falls outside every neighbourhood polygon** (conservation
  guard, well under the 5% warn threshold). **335 of 407 hoods** have any
  dedicated route; the other 72 are true zeros at the join.
- ⚠️ **The metric is 82% off-road pathway, much of it river-valley and ravine
  trail** — so `bike_m_per_acre` peaks in exactly the set-aside hoods that
  generate almost no revenue (top 4: MILL CREEK RAVINE NORTH/SOUTH, RIVER VALLEY
  WALTERDALE/GLENORA, all set-aside). Same shape as the `RATIO_ROAD_FLOOR`
  denominator artifact. The UI blurb says so.
- **`web/data/bike_routes.json`** (committed, lazy-loaded, 0.24 MB, 4,049 welded
  path segments) is the map's context layer — the LRT-lines format
  (`{"lines": [...]}`), geometry only, no per-feature value.

## 16. Citywide Operating Budget Context (Data & Methods pod, added 2026-08-03)
`data/city_budget_context.json` — the four-row "how big is this against the
whole City budget" comparison in the Data & Methods popover. Manual reviewed
input (mill-rates pattern; NOT auto-fetched, NOT in the weekly refresh).
Reaches the frontend through `status.json` via
`generate_status.budget_context()`; the section hides itself if the file or the
manifest field is missing.

| line | $/yr | share of $3.8B |
|---|---|---|
| Transit (bus + LRT + DATS, gross operating) | $468.571M | 12.18% |
| Roads (maintenance + snow) | $102.521M | 2.67% |
| Bike lanes & shared pathways (maintenance + snow) | $30.420M | 0.79% |
| Sidewalks (ops) | $5.900M | 0.15% |

Total City operating budget **$3,845,555,000 (2025)** — publicly quoted as
"$3.8 billion". ✅ **Corroborated 2026-08-04** against the Open Budget portal
(§17): FY2025 **tax-supported** expenses total **$3,855,881,010**, so this value
is **99.73%** of it. Every share in the table divides by this number and it had
been relayed, so it was worth checking.

⚠️ **IT IS THE TAX-SUPPORTED BUDGET, NOT ALL FUNDS — and that is the RIGHT
denominator, not a limitation.** All-funds FY2025 is **$4,203,648,909**; the
difference is Utilities ($235.8M) and Enterprise/CRL ($112.0M). All four
numerators here are tax-supported, so an all-funds denominator would understate
every share (transit 11.15% instead of 12.18%, roads 2.44% instead of 2.67%).
**If the pod's "$3.8B operating budget" copy is ever reworded, do not let it
imply all funds.**

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **OPERATING ONLY, every line.** No capital anywhere: road reconstruction,
  asphalt overlay and the Neighbourhood Renewal Program on one side; new trains,
  garages and line extensions on the other. The rows are comparable **to each
  other** and none is a total cost. **Never let this read as "what
  transportation costs Edmonton."**
- ⚠️ **CITYWIDE — DO NOT WIRE TO THE SPATIAL PIPELINE.** The road figures span
  the ~11,000 km network **including arterials**; the neighbourhood lens
  excludes arterials by decision, so the two use different denominators and
  **must not share a constant**. Nothing in `src/` or `main.py` reads this file.
- ✅ **The roads-maintenance component is now PUBLISHED — and the derived figure
  it replaced was ~5× too low.** It was `$1,285/km × ~11,000 km = $14.135M`
  (a narrow unit rate multiplied across the whole network, with the
  *snow-clearing* network reused as the maintenance denominator). Now
  **$65,671,000**, the Open Budget portal's `Roadway Maintenance` program
  (FY2017) — see §17. `derived_component` is gone, so the pod's asterisk is gone.
  ⚠️ **The error was in OUR derivation, not the Taproot source** — that source's
  *totals* reconcile to 99.2% (below); only the rate×network product did not.
  The published program implies ~**$5,900/km**, not $1,285/km.
- ⚠️ **2017 IS THE ONLY YEAR WITH A ROADS-ONLY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM**, so a stale
  vintage is the price of a clean scope. The tree was re-cut in 2018 (folded into
  `Infrastructure Maintenance`, which *also* covers sidewalks, pathways and
  bridges — using it here would **double-count** against this table's own
  sidewalks and bike rows) and again in 2026 (`Mobility Infrastructure
  Services`). Peter's call 2026-08-04, documented rather than silently mixed, as
  with ETS 2025 vs fire 2026. Being 2017 dollars it is if anything a **lower
  bound**: the branch grew ~34% ($244.9M → $327.1M) by 2025.
- ✅ **THE SNOW FIGURES ARE INDEPENDENTLY CORROBORATED.** Roads snow $36.85M +
  path snow $30.15M = **$67.0M** against the portal's published `Snow and Ice
  Control` program at **$67,553,815 (FY2025) — 99.2%**. That is why the snow
  components were left untouched, and **the contrast with maintenance is what
  exposed it**: same source, one number reconciling and one not.
- ⚠️ **Transit here INCLUDES DATS ($31.966M); the per-acre transit cost column
  EXCLUDES it.** Different questions, and they are *supposed* to differ — §13's
  `transit_ets` allocates by scheduled stop-events, which DATS does not generate.
- ⚠️ **The Active Transportation Acceleration project ($4.3M) is deliberately
  NOT a row.** It is capital debt service + incremental maintenance for *new*
  build-out, while the bike line is the cost of running what exists — not
  additive. Kept in `excluded_from_the_table` so the figure is not lost.
- **Sidewalks and active transport are separate, non-overlapping categories** —
  sidewalks (~5,776 km) are not in the 1,500 km snow-clearing network, which the
  source enumerates. The two lines are safely additive.
- ⚠️ **NO SHARE OR RATIO IS EVER PUBLISHED** — the manifest carries dollars and a
  total, and the UI divides. The research this table came from shipped ratios
  that had slid one row (*"transit is roughly 15× the road ops budget"*; 15.4× is
  active transport, and sidewalks are 79.4×, not the claimed ~90×). Deriving
  makes that class of error unrepresentable. ⚠️ **The roads ratio has since moved
  on its own merits: 9.2× → 4.6×** on 2026-08-04, when the maintenance component
  was corrected. Because nothing pins a share, that was a **one-value edit** —
  which is the whole argument for the rule.

## 17. Open Budget Portal — program-level operating budgets (added 2026-08-04)
⚠️ **SAME PUBLICATION AS Socrata `da9s-v9j8` (§18), not an independent source** —
verified to the dollar 2026-08-16. Never cite the two as corroborating each
other; their agreement is a tautology.

`https://budget.edmonton.ca/api/operating_budget.csv` — the City's Open Budget
portal, **machine-readable and primary**. **7,283 rows, FY2017–FY2026**, one row
per `budget_year, fund_type, department, branch, program, category, account_type,
budget`. First fetched by hand on Peter's laptop 2026-08-04. **NOT downloaded by
`download_data.py`, NOT in the weekly refresh, NOT read by `src/` or `main.py`**
— it is a sourcing tool for the manual reviewed inputs (§13, §16), not a pipeline
input.

✅ **CORRECTED 2026-08-13 — IT IS REACHABLE FROM THE ORACLE BOX.** This line used
to add *"(edmonton.ca is unreachable from the Oracle box, §13)"* as the reason for
the laptop fetch. **`budget.edmonton.ca` is a different host from
`www.edmonton.ca`**: measured 2026-08-13 it returns `HTTP 200`, 1,037,656 bytes,
7,283 rows, while `www.edmonton.ca` fails to connect (`000`) in the same sweep.
`data.edmonton.ca`, `alberta.ca` and `open.alberta.ca` also resolve. ⚠️ **§13's
blanket "edmonton.ca is unreachable" is true only of `www.` — test the specific
host before recording a blocker from it.** (Two pieces of work were parked on the
generalised version: this fetch, and the ASSET manual on open.alberta.ca, which
turned out to be a transient 520 rather than a network policy.)

### Why it matters
It is the **only public source with sub-branch operating detail**. The Approved
Operating Budget PDF stops at branch level, where roads are bundled with parks
(`Parks and Roads Services`, FY2026 gross **$303.361M**; gross − revenue = net
cross-checks) — far too coarse to source a roads line. The portal resolves that
branch into programs: `Roadway Maintenance`, `Snow and Ice Control`,
`Parks Operations`, `Traffic Operations, Signals and Street Lighting`, and more.

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **THE PROGRAM TREE WAS RE-CUT TWICE AND PROGRAM NAMES DO NOT SURVIVE IT** —
  a "format eras" problem exactly like §11's FIR debt series. **2017:** roads-only
  programs (`Roadway Maintenance` **$65.671M**, `Snow and Ice Control` $63.709M).
  **2018–2025:** renamed and re-scoped to `OPS/PARS - Infrastructure Maintenance`
  ($49.7M–$56.9M), which **also covers sidewalks, pathways and bridges**.
  **2026:** re-cut again into `OPS/PARS - Mobility Infrastructure Services`
  ($76.95M). **Never build a time series by program name without checking which
  era each year is in** — a naive `groupby(program)` shows most programs
  abruptly hitting zero, which is a rename, not a cut.
- ⚠️ **`account_type` IS `Expenses` ONLY** — there is no revenue side here, so
  every figure is **gross**, never net. `fund_type` is `Tax Supported` for this
  branch.
- ⚠️ **THE PORTAL AND THE PDF DO NOT TIE EXACTLY.** Portal FY2026 Parks and Roads
  Services totals **$307,325,053** against the PDF's **$303,361,000** gross,
  **+1.31%**. Small, but they are different publications — do not present them as
  one series.
- **`category` is expense TYPE, not service** (Personnel, Fleet Services,
  Materials, External Services, Intra-municipal Charges…), and **intra-municipal
  lines are negative**, so category sums net out. Fine for totals; useless for
  splitting a program by what it maintains.
- **`/api/services.csv` does not exist** — it returns a 404 page. Only
  `operating_budget.csv` and `capital_projects.csv` were confirmed live.

### What it has already settled
- **§16's roads-maintenance component**, $14.135M (derived, ~5× low) →
  **$65.671M** published.
- **Corroborated §16's snow figures to 99.2%** — roads $36.85M + paths $30.15M =
  $67.0M vs the published `Snow and Ice Control` program $67,553,815 (FY2025).

### Cross-checks it enabled on the OTHER manual reviewed inputs
Run 2026-08-04. **None changed a committed value**; all are recorded so the
inputs are corroborated rather than merely relayed.

| repo figure | committed | portal | agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| §16 total operating budget (2025) | $3,845,555,000 | $3,855,881,010 *(tax-supported)* | **99.7%** |
| §13 `fire_response` gross (2026) | $276,706,000 | $279,264,931 *(Fire Rescue Services branch)* | **99.1%** |
| §16 transit incl. DATS (2025) | $468,571,000 | $482,556,115 *(Edmonton Transit Service branch)* | **97.1%** |

- **Fire's 0.9% gap is the portal-vs-PDF gap**, same direction and size as the
  +1.31% seen on Parks and Roads — the repo figure is from the Approved
  Operating Budget PDF. Not an error in either.
- ⚠️ **Transit differs by ~3% and it is a SOURCE difference, not a mistake.**
  The repo takes bus+LRT **$436.605M** and DATS **$31.966M** from the ETS
  2024/2025 Annual Service Plan; the portal shows **$449.11M** and **$33.45M**
  for the same year. **Immaterial to the map**: `cost_transit_ops_per_acre`
  divides the budget by the pipeline's own citywide stop-event total, so a
  uniform ~3% scales every neighbourhood identically and moves no relative
  pattern. **Do not "fix" one source to the other** — the Annual Service Plan is
  the one that separates bus+LRT from DATS, which is what
  `transit_ets.chosen_numerator` requires.

## 18. Ranked branch operating budget — the `/full/` budget panel (added 2026-08-16)
`web/data/budget_ranked.json`, generated by `scripts/export_budget_ranked.py`
from Socrata **`da9s-v9j8`** ("Approved Operating Budget - Expenses") on
`data.edmonton.ca`.

⚠️ **`da9s-v9j8` IS §17's `budget.edmonton.ca/api/operating_budget.csv`, NOT A
SECOND SOURCE.** Verified 2026-08-16 by identity, because it arrived as a
"new dataset" suggestion and the two would otherwise be presented as
corroborating each other:

| check | §17 (portal CSV) | `da9s-v9j8` |
|---|---|---|
| columns | 8: `budget_year … budget` | identical |
| rows / years | 7,283, FY2017–FY2026 | 7,283, FY2017–FY2026 |
| FY2025 tax-supported total | $3,855,881,010 | **$3,855,881,010** |
| FY2026 Parks and Roads Services | $307,325,053 | **$307,325,053** |

Both tie **to the dollar**. Treat any agreement between them as a tautology, never
as corroboration. **What actually changes is the host:** `data.edmonton.ca` is
the one the rest of the pipeline already talks to, so this needs no new network
path — §17's hand-fetch does.

### Cadence — NOT weekly, and not "continually updated"
The dataset's own `rowsUpdatedAt` was **2026-06-05** when first pulled (~10 weeks
stale at the time), and that is normal: an *approved* budget moves when Council
approves a budget or an adjustment, roughly annually. ⚠️ **It must not ride the
weekly refresh.** The assessment roll moves weekly; letting the two share a
cadence would imply a freshness this data does not have. Manual, reviewed input
on the mill-rates pattern (§11, §16) — run the script by hand, eyeball the diff,
commit. The output carries the source's `rows_updated_at`, and the panel prints
it, so the panel dates itself from the SOURCE rather than from the run.

### The split, and why it is derived rather than a branch list
The panel ranks branches in two blocks. A branch is **"other"** iff it has zero
dollars in any of `Personnel`, `Materials, Goods and Supplies`, `External
Services`, `Fleet Services`, `Utilities & Other Charges`, `Intra-municipal
Charges` — i.e. it employs nobody and buys nothing, it only moves money.
Measured FY2026: **43 service branches, 5 other.**

⚠️ **Why the split exists at all:** `Capital Project Financing` is **$687.6M**,
the single largest line in the tax-supported budget — ahead of Police. An unsplit
ranking answers "what does Edmonton spend most on?" with *debt service*.

⚠️ **Classifying by CATEGORY instead would be wrong**, and this was measured:
`Transfer to Reserves` spans **11 branches including Police ($14.3M)**, so a
category filter strips service branches of parts of their own budget.

⚠️ **`Corporate Expenditures` is NOT financing despite the name** — it is WCB,
Risk Management, Sundry, LTD liability and incentive grants. It lands in "other"
because it delivers no service, not because it is debt. The other four are
`Capital Project Financing`, `Neighbourhood Renewal`, `Taxation Expenditures`,
`Automated Enforcement`.

The rule is applied to the data on every run and **never hardcoded as a branch
list**, because the budget tree gets re-cut (§17 records two re-cuts of the
PROGRAM tree inside Parks and Roads alone) and a name list would silently
misclassify on the first rename. The classification is written into the output
precisely so a human diff catches membership drift.

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **Gross, and operating only.** No capital programme, and no revenue offset,
  so **no line here is a net cost**. The revenue side is a sibling dataset,
  `m84q-ghmu` ("Approved Operating Budget - Revenues", 1,414 rows, same 8
  columns) — **not read by anything yet**. §17's *"there is no revenue side
  here"* is true of the expense feed only; the sibling closes that gap if it is
  ever wanted.
- **Branch totals are net of intra-municipal recoveries**, which are negative
  lines (`Intra-municipal Recoveries` is **-$219.8M** across 27 branches). That
  is what makes them safe to sum without double-counting internal cross-charges,
  but a branch total is therefore **not** what that branch spends in the world.
- **`Tax Supported` only** by default — the correct denominator, matching §16.
  FY2026 all-funds adds Utilities ($246.6M) and Enterprise/CRL ($127.7M).
- ⚠️ **Citywide totals with NO neighbourhood dimension.** Nothing here joins to
  the map, and nothing in `src/` or `main.py` imports it — the same boundary
  §16 states, for the same reason.

### Integrity rules (the script refuses to publish otherwise)
Branch totals must reconcile to the cent against an independently queried fund
total; every branch must classify and both blocks must be non-empty; a negative
branch total hard-fails; an unknown budget year hard-fails. `tests/test_export_budget_ranked.py`
covers each guard.

## 19. Approved Capital Budget — profile level (added 2026-08-22)
`data/capital_budget.csv`, hand-fetched from
**`https://budget.edmonton.ca/api/capital_budget.csv`** — the same Open Budget
portal host as §17, whose capital endpoints had never been probed.

⚠️ **THE OPEN DATA PORTAL HAS NO CAPITAL BUDGET.** Searched `data.edmonton.ca`
2026-08-21: approved-budget datasets are `da9s-v9j8` (operating expenses, §18)
and `m84q-ghmu` (operating revenues) — **both OPERATING** — plus `552h-hjwj`
(214 rows, the `building.edmonton.ca` app feed, 4 asset types) and a 2015 relic
(`pdmi-3qjb` / `r993-376i`). None of them is the capital budget. Do not go
looking for a Socrata capital sibling again; there isn't one.

**1,884 rows**, one per `fiscal_year, service, branch, profile_id, profile,
fund_type, fund, approved`. FY**2023–2037**, **$11,510,831,000** total.

⚠️ **THE GRAIN IS NOT ONE ROW PER PROJECT.** 1,884 rows carry only **399 distinct
`profile_id`s** — a profile repeats across fiscal years AND across funding
sources (up to **8 rows** for a single year+profile). Any per-project count or
average must `groupby("profile_id")` first; `len(df)` is a row count, not a
project count.

⚠️ **`approved` GOES NEGATIVE — 87 rows totalling −$161,302,000.** These are
funding-source reallocations, not cancellations: `15-75-0108 Mitchell Transit
Garage` carries **+$500,000 Developer / Partner Financing and −$500,000
Pay-As-You-Go** in the same year, netting to zero. **$11.51B is the NET**
(gross positive $11,672,133,000). ⚠️ **This breaks naive `fund_type` filtering** —
"how much is PAYG-funded?" is wrong unless the negatives are carried, and they
straddle fund types by construction, so a positives-only filter double-counts
the swap. 7 year+profile pairs net to exactly $0.

| | |
|---|---|
| dense window | **2023–2026 = $9,216,794,000** (the approved four-year cycle) |
| tails | carry-forwards only — 60 rows in 2027 falling to 1 in 2037 |
| top services | LRT Expansion $4.10B · Roads $1.48B · Recreation & Culture $1.02B · Yellowhead Freeway Conversion $789M · Neighbourhoods $716M |
| `fund_type` | Grants $4.60B · Tax-Supported Debt $3.50B · Reserves $1.23B · PAYG $852M · Retained Earnings $766M · CRL $290M |

A sibling `capital_projects.csv` (399 rows: `profile_id` → description, phase,
address, **lat/long**) is **NOT committed** — see the join-coverage warning in
`docs/ANALYSIS_BACKLOG.md` §11 before building anything spatial on it.

### Cadence — ⚠️ NOT annual, and there is NO freshness header
The capital budget is a **four-year cycle** moved by supplemental adjustments —
not weekly, not annual. **Manual reviewed input** (§13, §16, §18 pattern);
`download_data.py` does not fetch it and nothing in `src/` or `main.py` reads it.

⚠️ **`Last-Modified` merely ECHOES `Date`, behind `Cache-Control: no-cache`** —
there is no `rowsUpdatedAt` equivalent (§18), so **the committed file IS the
pin** and `vintage_report.check_capital_budget` compares content, not dates.
Any figure published from this must date itself from the **budget cycle**, never
from the fetch. The `⚠️ Capital budget` digest row is `docs/RUNBOOK.md` §1a.

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **NEW-VS-RENEWAL IS NOT A PUBLISHED FIELD.** Only two profiles are named
  outright (`Transportation: Neighbourhoods - Renewal` $69.8M,
  `Transportation: Bridges & Auxiliary Structures - Renewal` $50.7M); everything
  else would have to be inferred from words like "Reconstruction" in `profile`.
  **That is the `DATA_INTEGRITY.md` T8 hand-enumeration shape** — a value-sum
  over a name-matched set with no self-check. A keyword pass gives ~$1.02B
  renewal / ~$1.49B new across the road-ish services for 2023–26; treat it as
  **indicative only and do not publish a split sourced that way.**
- **The endpoint is byte-stable** (two fetches identical, 2026-08-21) but is
  generated per request, so the digest hashes **sorted** rows — a server-side
  reorder must not read as a budget change.
- ⚠️ **`approved` is a BUDGET, not spend.** These are approved profile amounts
  across a multi-year cycle, not cash out the door in any given year, and the
  2027+ rows are carry-forward. Never sum a `fiscal_year` slice and call it
  annual spending.
- ⚠️ **This is the CAPITAL side and §18 is the OPERATING side. Never sum them.**
  Same rule, same reason, as `city_unit_costs.json`'s `_two_bases`.

## 20. Schools + amenity distance (grid columns, added 2026-08-23)

Feeds `value_grid.json`'s `dist_lrt_m` / `dist_school_m` — road-network metres
from a cell to the nearest LRT station and catchment school. Built by
`src/load_schools.py` + `src/amenity_distance.py`; the station set comes from
`load_transit.derive_lrt_stations`. Design + the locked calls:
`docs/SPEC_development.md` "Amenity distance", `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-23.

### Sources
| dataset | id | rows | fetched |
|---|---|---|---|
| EPSB School Locations | `996c-239n` | 225 | `download_data.py --only schools_public` |
| Edmonton Catholic Schools (Current) | `gfxq-u8uu` | 97 | `--only schools_catholic` |
| LRT stations | — | 30 | derived from the GTFS already on disk (§9) |
| Road graph | `9j8t-zm52` | 39,515 walkable | the roads file the services lens uses (§7) |

Both school datasets carry `latitude`/`longitude` (zero nulls, 2026-08-23) and a
grade field, and **their schemas disagree**: EPSB has `sch_type` (`EL`/`EJ`/`JR`/
`SR`/`SP`/…) plus a free-text `grades`; ECSD has `grade_level` (`Elementary`,
`Junior`, `Senior`, `Outreach`, and comma-joined combinations) plus
`grades_offered`. `load_schools` harmonizes them; neither field is parsed as text.

### ⚠️ Coverage gap — this is NOT every school in Edmonton
The portal publishes the two public boards and nothing else. **Private, charter,
and francophone (Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord) schools are absent**, so
`dist_school_m` overstates distance for any block whose nearest school is one of
them. Never label the column "distance to the nearest school".

**⚠️ AND IT CANNOT BE CLOSED FROM DATA WE HOLD — probed three ways 2026-08-23:**

1. **The property/assessment roll cannot say what anything IS.** A parcel carries
   account number, address, `lot_size`, `Total Gross Area`, `year_built`,
   `zoning` and value — and `legal_description` is `Plan / Block / Lot` only.
   **Zero of 439,685 rows mention "school"** in any field. A private school and a
   warehouse differ only by zone code.
2. **Zoning does not substitute.** The institutional-ish zones are `PS` (751
   parcels), `PSN` (949) and `US` (**1**) — `US` being the zone schools nominally
   sit in, which is by itself proof the per-property `zoning` field is not where
   that fact reliably lives (the same lesson as the 2026-08-01 polygons-not-field
   reversal). Even clean, "institutional land" is hospitals, fire halls, places of
   worship and community leagues — not schools.
3. **The portal has no such dataset.** A catalogue search for `school` returns
   the two boards, their catchment areas, ward boundaries, building footprints
   and historical vintages — nothing private, charter or francophone. Alberta
   publishes lists that DO cover them (*Alberta's francophone regional
   authorities and schools*, *Alberta accredited international schools*) but as
   **PDFs**, not addressable rows.

**The remedy is manual, not blocked** — transcribe + geocode the provincial PDF
list; `amenity_distance` takes any point frame. ⚠️ **A hand-built list would go
STALE SILENTLY** while the two board feeds refresh weekly. Open in
`docs/ANALYSIS_BACKLOG.md` §13.

### Known Quirks
- ⚠️ **19 rows are city-wide programs, not neighbourhood schools**, and they sit
  in the same table as the catchment ones: EPSB `sch_type == 'SP'` (15 — the four
  Learning Store storefronts, Glenrose Hospital, Metro Continuing Ed., AB School
  for Deaf, Braemar, Aspen Program, L. Y. Cairns, …) and ECSD
  `grade_level == 'Outreach'` (4 — the CCAC centres). Including them would put a
  fake "school nearby" on downtown and hospital cells. Excluded by **enumerated
  category** in `load_schools`; an unknown category is KEPT and logged.
- ⚠️ **The 33 GTFS LRT "stations" include a tail track and two bus-garage
  platforms** (`Heath Sciences Tail Track`, `DL Macdonald Platform`,
  `Kathleen Andrews Platform`). They sit on the alignment and take a scheduled
  time on every trip, so trip counts do NOT separate them. What does: a passenger
  station has at least one `location_type == 2` **street entrance** child, and
  those three have none. 30 stations survive. ⚠️ **The 58 `location_type == 1`
  stops are a DIFFERENT and wrong set** — that one mixes LRT with bus transit
  centres, and it is what the `transit_stations.json` context dots draw.
- ⚠️ **Railway centrelines are excluded from the road graph on purpose.** Routing
  over them lets a walk travel *along the LRT track* to reach an LRT station.
  Dropping alleys + railways also leaves the graph better connected: 163,841
  nodes at 99.83% in one component vs 186,931 at 99.45% unfiltered.
- **`responsible_party` is NOT filtered here**, unlike `load_roads`. That filter
  exists there because the services lens measures what the City maintains; a
  provincial or private road is still walkable, and excluding it carves holes.
- **440 of 439,685 properties (0.1%) cannot reach any amenity** over the graph —
  they sit in one of the 17 disconnected fragments. They emit `null`, never a
  large sentinel a filter would read as a real "far away".
- **Points snap to the nearest graph NODE, not the nearest point on an edge.**
  Measured over 20,000 real properties: median 3.5 m of excess, p90 35 m, p99
  67 m, 0.19% over 100 m. It always ADDS distance, so the error direction
  under-claims proximity.
- ⚠️ **Road centrelines are a walk PROXY, not a walkshed.** Sidewalks, river-valley
  trails, shared-use paths and pedestrian bridges are not in the source, so a
  block whose real route is a footpath reads as further than it is.
- Distribution on the 2026-07-06 snapshot: `dist_lrt_m` median 5,346 m per cell,
  **554 cells (1.6%) within 600 m**; `dist_school_m` median 982 m, **37.8% within
  800 m**. Network/euclidean ratio to LRT: median **1.36**.

## 21. Alberta FIR Schedule MR — the filed taxable base (roll-year guard, added 2026-08-25)

**Source:** Alberta Municipal Affairs — Municipal Financial and Statistical
Data (FIR/SIR), `https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/municipal-financial-and-statistical-data`
— the **same workbooks** `scripts/fetch_fir_debt.py` already downloads for
Schedule AA (§11). That script reads one sheet of 51; this reads three more.
**Fetch:** `scripts/fetch_fir_tax_base.py` → committed `data/fir_tax_base.json`.
**Manual, reviewed input** (the mill-rates / `fir_debt_series` pattern): NOT part
of the weekly refresh. Re-run when a new financial year publishes, eyeball the
diff, commit. **Licence:** Open Government Licence – Alberta.

**What it holds** — Edmonton (FIR code `0098`), per year, from three sheets:
`MR(1)-Tax Levy`, `MR(2)-Assessment`, `MR(3)-Mill Rate`. These are what the
City **filed with the province**, so they are an external anchor on numbers the
project otherwise only models.

| year | filed residential taxable base | filed municipal levy (all classes) |
|---|---|---|
| 2023 | $131,284,317,914 | — |
| 2024 | $134,439,557,008 | — |
| 2025 | $148,128,818,480 | $2,297,399,678 |
| 2026 | $160,372,669,990 | $2,509,075,991 |

✅ **`MR(2)` is the TAXABLE base by construction, and the fetcher asserts it**
(`check_internal_consistency`): `assessment × MR(3) rate` reproduces `MR(1)`
levy to **±0.0000%** for Residential, Farmland and Non-Residential. ✅ **`MR(3)`
matches `data/mill_rates.json` exactly** (2026: Residential `7.7419`,
Non-Residential `25.2216`) — independent confirmation our rate inputs are right.

**Why it exists: the roll year is not recoverable from Socrata metadata.**
Edmonton left `Period of Coverage` reading `2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31` for the
whole 2026 roll, so `check_year_alignment.py` — which parsed that string —
reported "aligned" while the pipeline billed a 2026 roll at 2025 rates.
`scripts/check_roll_year_against_fir.py` measures the parcels instead:
residential land is barely exempt, so our residential base lands within ~1% of
the filed base for the right year and ~10% off for a neighbouring one.

### ⚠️ Known quirks
- **The buckets are NOT 1:1 with our tax classes.** `MR(2)` column [10] is
  *"Other (including annexed, vacant, total minimum tax, etc.)"*, **not** "Other
  Residential" — but Edmonton has no apartment slot in Schedule MR and files
  that sub-class there. Established from the **implied rate** (levy ÷
  assessment = `8.2872`, within 1.0% of our Other Residential `8.2064`), not
  from the label. ⚠️ **Only `residential` is safe to compare directly**, and it
  is the only column the year guard uses.
- **Machinery & Equipment is assessed and NOT levied.** 2026: $759,582,941 at a
  `0.0000` rate → $0. Edmonton levies no municipal tax on M&E and our roll has
  no such class, so it cannot enter a levy comparison — but it does make our
  assessment base look ~$760M *smaller* than the province's.
- **The newest year arrives in `YYYY_tax_rates.xlsx`**, ahead of the full
  `YYYY_financial_year.xlsx`. `discover_resources` accepts both and prefers the
  financial workbook when both exist.
- **Column positions are checked, not trusted.** `_check_header` raises if
  Schedule MR's headers stop matching the expected substrings, rather than
  reading a shifted column blind.

## 17. Parkades and Surface Lots (Transportation lens, added 2026-08-31)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data dataset `tsq5-xp73` — "Parkades and Surface Lots".
Downloaded by `scripts/download_data.py` as `data/raw/parking_facilities.csv`
with a deliberately small `$limit=100` plus the standard server `count(*)`
cross-check. First pull: **9 source rate/use rows**, matching server count.

**Scope guard:** this is **City-managed public parking supply**, not all parking
in Edmonton. The feed contains public parkades and surface lots the City owns or
leases. Private parkades, private surface lots, curbside stalls not represented
in this feed, and informal/off-street parking are outside scope. UI wording
should stay narrow: "City-managed parking", "City-managed parking facilities",
or "City-managed parking supply".

**Key columns:** `parking_facilities`, `owned_leased`, `type`, `total_stalls`,
`use`, `billing_type`, `regular_rate`, `_5_gst`, `monthly_rate`,
`effective_year`, `location_1`.

**Current shape:** 7 physical facilities / **2,841 stalls** from 9 rate/use rows:
7 `Parkade` rows and 2 `Surface Lot` rows. `Century Place Parkade` and
`City Hall Parkade` each appear twice for distinct rate/use options.

**Pipeline handling:** `src/load_parking.py` parses the CSV location string,
spatially assigns facilities to neighbourhoods, and deduplicates capacity by
physical facility key (`parking_facilities` + rounded coordinate). Duplicate
rate/use rows are preserved in `web/data/parking_facilities.json` as popup
options, but stalls are counted once per physical facility in neighbourhood
aggregates. Joined columns include:

- `parking_facilities_total`, `parking_parkade_facilities`,
  `parking_surface_lot_facilities`
- `parking_stalls_total`, `parking_parkade_stalls`,
  `parking_surface_lot_stalls`
- `parking_stalls_per_acre`, plus `parking_stalls_per_1000_people` when the
  2021 Census population denominator is present
- `cost_parking_ops_annual` and `cost_parking_ops_per_acre` when
  `parking_ops` is present in `data/city_unit_costs.json`. This is a modeled
  share of the 2025 Parking Operations gross operating budget, allocated by
  deduplicated stall count; it is not private parking cost and not
  facility-level accounting.

## 18. 2021 Federal Census population (Transportation denominator, added 2026-08-31)

**Source:** Edmonton Open Data dataset `eg3i-f4bj` — "2021 Federal Census: Population". This is the City of Edmonton Neighbourhood Profiles / Federal Census 2021 population source; the same population family is surfaced in the City's Tableau Public Neighbourhood Profiles workbook. That Tableau page has an interactive neighbourhood dropdown: its default selected neighbourhood is `ABBOTTSFIELD`, and other neighbourhoods can be selected in the workbook UI. The pipeline downloads the Socrata CSV (`data/raw/census_population_2021.csv`) because the static/simple Tableau crosstab CSV endpoint reflects the current/default workbook selection unless a workbook session/filter is driven interactively.

**Use in this project:** denominator only. The Transportation view can show absolute road kilometres, dedicated bike-route kilometres, or City-managed parking stalls directly from total supply columns. It may also show those same measures per 1,000 residents only when the web GeoJSON carries both:

- measured total supply (`road_m_total`, `bike_m_total`, or `parking_stalls_total`), and
- `census_population_2021` from this source.

No population is estimated or interpolated. Neighbourhoods without a 2021 Census row stay missing for the per-resident mode; the app falls back to the area denominator (`km / km²`) where person denominators are unavailable.

**Name alignment:** the 2021 Census source still names `Oliver`; the current assessment/boundary data uses `WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN`, so `load_population.py` maps `OLIVER` → `WÎHKWÊNTÔWIN` before joining.
