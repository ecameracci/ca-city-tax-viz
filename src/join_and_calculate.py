    Assessment names are expected to be corrected and aggregated already
    (NAME_CORRECTIONS is applied upstream in load_assessment.py). The one
    expected unmatched case — the OLIVER straggler row, deliberately left
    unmapped (DATA.md "Name Matching") — surfaces here as a warning.

    ``zoning`` (optional, from load_zoning.py) adds the ZONING_COLUMNS — the
    set-aside flags, the residential-lens flag, and the full land-use
    composition fractions (use-mix view) — merged on neighbourhood_name.
    Degrades gracefully when absent, like the revenue columns; boundaries with
    no zoning match default to is_set_aside=False (stays on scale) and
    is_residential=False (frac_* left NaN), and are flagged.

    ``roads`` (optional, from load_roads.py) adds road_m_total and computes
    road_m_per_acre against boundary area_acres (SPEC_services.md). Boundaries
    with no roads overlay default to 0 — genuinely zero city-maintained
    collector/local road, unlike the zoning NaNs — and are flagged.

    ``bike`` (optional, from load_bike.py) adds bike_m_total and computes
    bike_m_per_acre the same way (SPEC_services.md "Transportation lens").
    DEDICATED cycling assets only — shared roadways are excluded upstream
    because their metres are already in road_m_total, so the two supply
    columns are disjoint and may be read together. Boundaries with no
    dedicated route default to a true 0.

    ``parking`` (optional, from load_parking.py) adds City-managed public
    parking facility/stall counts from the parkades + surface lots feed. The
    feed has rate/use rows, so load_parking deduplicates physical facilities
    before summing capacity. Boundaries with no facility default to true 0.

    ``stormwater`` (optional, from load_stormwater.py) adds the MODELED
    storm_charge_annual and computes storm_charge_per_acre against boundary
    area_acres (SPEC_utilities.md Lens 1). Boundaries with no modeled points
    default to $0 (roads semantics: no roll parcels there means no modeled
    charge) — with the shared caveat that the roll omits exempt institutional
    land, so hood totals understate where exempt land dominates.

    ``fire`` (optional, from load_fire.py) adds fire_events_per_year and
    computes fire_events_per_acre against boundary area_acres
    (SPEC_services.md "Fire lens"). Boundaries with no events default to a
    true 0/yr (roads semantics: no dispatched emergency events recorded
    there in the window) — and are flagged.

    ``transit`` (optional, from load_transit.py) adds transit_dep_total —
    mean-weekday SCHEDULED stop-events, a supply proxy, not ridership — and
    computes transit_dep_per_acre against boundary area_acres
    (SPEC_services.md "Transit lens"). Boundaries with no served stops
    default to a true 0 (roads semantics) — and are flagged.

    ``water`` (optional, from load_water.py) adds the MODELED residential
    water + sanitary columns (WATER_COLUMNS) and computes
    water_charge_per_acre / water_fixed_per_acre against boundary area_acres
    (SPEC_utilities.md Lens 2). Boundaries with no modeled connections
    default to $0 (stormwater semantics; commercial-only hoods are genuinely
    out of the residential scope) — and are flagged.

    ``franchise`` (optional, from load_franchise.py) adds the MODELED
    electricity/gas franchise columns (FRANCHISE_COLUMNS) — City-revenue
    lines plus the collinear dwelling_count (SPEC_utilities.md Lens 3).
    Carried on the full frame only (no per-acre, no SLIM — no display layer
    yet). Boundaries with no modeled dwellings default to 0 (water semantics)
    — and are flagged.

    ``unit_costs`` (optional, from load_unit_costs — data/city_unit_costs.json,
    the manual reviewed input) adds the V2 MODELED composite
    svc_cost_per_acre = road_m_per_acre × $/road-metre/yr
    + fire_events_per_acre × (fire budget ÷ the pipeline's own citywide
    kept-event total) (SPEC_utilities decision 3). Roads + fire ONLY — never
    "total city cost" — and the fire term is a demand ALLOCATION of a mostly-
    fixed budget, not a marginal cost; both caveats belong in any display copy.
    Requires BOTH the roads and fire frames: with either missing the composite
    would be a mislabeled one-term metric, so it is skipped with a warning.

    ``population`` (optional, from load_population.py) adds 2021 Federal Census
    neighbourhood population totals, used only as a denominator for
    Transportation per-resident readouts. It is not interpolated or estimated;
    boundaries with no Census row remain NaN and are hidden from per-person
    mode.

    ``lot_acres`` (optional, from export_value_grid.build_hood_lot_acres) adds
    the neighbourhood lot-acre denominator toggle: value_per_lot_acre /
    revenue_per_lot_acre (eligible dollars / deduped parcel acres) plus
    parcel_frac (parcel land / boundary land). Hoods below LOW_PARCEL_FRAC
    parcel land are suppressed to NaN (n/a grey) so the near-zero-denominator
    tail doesn't explode; parcel_frac still ships for the tooltip. An editorial
    alternative denominator (docs/FINDINGS_denominator_cardinality.md), NOT a
    fix — the ground-acre metric stays the cardinality-robust default.

# to support per-resident denominators when 2021 Census population is present);
# road_m_per_acre, storm_charge_per_acre,
# fire_events_per_acre, and the water_* pair are the Services-view metrics
# (SPEC_services.md, SPEC_utilities.md — ratios only, totals stay out of the
# slim file like total_assessed_value does; the storm and water figures are
# MODELED, not billed — water additionally residential-scope only, with the
# fixed column shipping alongside the total so the client can show the
# connection-vs-consumption split — the fire figure is dispatched-event
# DEMAND, not coverage, and the transit figure is SCHEDULED service supply,
# not ridership; the client must label all of them as such). svc_cost_per_acre
# is the V2 composite — MODELED road $ + allocated fire $, roads + fire only,
# never "total city cost" (SPEC_utilities decision 3; no display layer yet —
# placement is an open call). The cost_*_ops_per_acre trio and
# transport_cost_ops_per_acre are the Transportation lens Stage 2 composite on a
# strictly OPERATING basis (maintenance + snow, NO capital replacement) —
# ⚠️ cost_roads_ops_per_acre and the roads term inside svc_cost_per_acre are the
# SAME METRES ON DIFFERENT BASES, ~10.8x apart; the client must never sum or
# compare them, which is what the _ops suffix exists to signal. new_units_per_acre
# and new_permits_per_acre (+ the total/permit-count pair for the tooltip) are the
# Development lens A activity metrics — new dwelling units / new permits from
# issued permits, a change/flow signal, NOT revenue or cost (SPEC_development.md).
# ind_permits_per_acre (+ ind_permits count) is the industrial permit-velocity
# cut — new-construction 400-series building_type permits per acre, count only
# (units_added is meaningless for industrial), same windows (SPEC_industrial.md A3).
# res_revenue_per_acre / res_revenue_per_lot_acre are the residential-revenue
# decomposition: the RESIDENTIAL + OTHER RESIDENTIAL class subset of the levy
# (a subset of revenue_per_acre, never all of what the land pays — the client
# must say so); the residential SHARE is derived client-side as res/revenue
# per acre (same denominator cancels), so no share column ships.
# nonres_revenue_per_acre / nonres_revenue_per_lot_acre are the complement by
# rate class (COMMERCIAL + MA DERELICT + DESIGNATED IND PROPERTIES slices —
# SPEC_industrial.md A1), same conventions.
